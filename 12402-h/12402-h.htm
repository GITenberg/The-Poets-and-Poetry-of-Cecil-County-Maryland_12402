<h1>Preface.</h1>


<p class="prose">
This volume owes its existence to the desire of some of the teachers and
pupils of the public schools in the northeastern part of Cecil county,
to do honor to the memory of the late School Commissioner David Scott.
Shortly after Mr. Scott&#8217;s death, some of the parties referred to,
proposed to collect enough money by voluntary contributions to erect a
monument over his grave, in order to perpetuate his memory, and also to
show the high regard in which he was held by them. This project being
brought to the knowledge of the editor, he ventured to express the
opinion that the best monument Mr. Scott could have, would be the
collection and publication of his poems in book form. This suggestion
met the approbation of the originators of the project, who asked the
writer to undertake the work of collecting the poems and editing the
book. Subsequent investigation showed that Mr. Scott had not left enough
poems to justify their publication in a volume by themselves; and the
original plan of the work was changed, so as to include, so far as it
has been practicable to do so, the writings of all the native poets of
the county, and those who though not natives, have resided and written
in it.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Owing to causes not necessary to state it was impracticable, in some
cases, to make as creditable a selection as could have been made had it
been possible to have had access to all the poetry of the different
writers. In a few instances the book contains all the poetry of the
different writers that it has been practicable to obtain. Herein, it is
hoped, will be found sufficient apology, if any apology is needed, for
the character of some of the matter in the book.
</p>

<p class="prose">
If any apology is needed for the prominence given to the poems of David
Scott (of John.) it may be found in the foregoing statement concerning
the origin of the book; and in the fact, that, for more than a quarter
of a century, the editor was probably his most intimate friend. So
intimate indeed were the relations between Mr. Scott and the writer,
that the latter had the pleasure of reading many of his friend&#8217;s
poems before they were published. The same may be said in a more
extended sense, of the poems of David Scott (of James) to whose example
and teaching, as well as to that of the other Mr. Scott&#8212;for he was
a pupil of each of them&#8212;the writer owes much of whatever literary
ability he may possess.
</p>

<p class="prose">
The editor is also on terms of intimacy with many of the other
contemporary writers whose poetry appears in the book, and has striven
to do justice to their literary ability, by the selection of such of
their poems as are best calculated, in his opinion, to do credit to
them, without offending the taste of the most fastidious readers of the
book.
</p>

<p class="prose">
From the foregoing statement it will be apparent that the object of the
editor was not to produce a book of poetical jems, but only to select
the poems best adapted to the exemplification of the diversified talents
of their authors. The work has been a labor of love; and though
conscious that it has been imperfectly performed, the compiler ventures
to express the hope that it will be received by a generous and
discriminating public, in the same spirit in which it was done.
</p>




<h1>Editorial Notes.</h1>


<p class="prose">
It is a remarkable fact that all the native poets of Cecil county except
one or two were born in the northern part of it, and within about eight
miles of the boundary line between Maryland and Pennsylvania. What
effect, if any, the pure atmosphere and picturesque scenery of the
country along the banks and romantic hills of the Susquehanna and
Octoraro may have had to do with producing or developing poetical
genius, cannot be told; but nevertheless it is a fact, that William P.,
and Edwin E. Ewing, Emma Alice Browne, Alice Coale Simpers, John M.
Cooley and Rachel E. Patterson were born and wrote much of their poetry,
as did also Mrs. Caroline Hall, in that beautifully diversified and
lovely section of the county.
</p>

<p class="prose">
It is also worthy of note that Tobias and Zebulon Rudulph were brothers,
as are also William P. and Edwin E. Ewing; and that Mrs. Caroline Hall
was of the same family; and that Folger McKinsey and William J. Jones
are cousins, as are also Mrs. James McCormick and Mrs. Frank J.
Darlington, and Emma Alice Browne and George Johnston.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Owing to the fact that the size of the book was necessarily limited by
the price of it; and to the fact that the poems of three of the writers
were not obtained until after a large part of the book had been printed,
it was impossible to give some of the writers, whose proper places were
in the latter part of the book, as much space as was desirable. For the
reason just stated, the editor was compelled to omit a large number of
excellent poems, written by David Scott (of James,) and others.

<h1><a id="a-a" name="a-a">David Scott <span style="text-transform: none">(of John.)</span></a></h1>


<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">David Scott</span> (of John,) so-called to distinguish him from his first
cousin David Scott (of James,) was the grandson of David Scott, who
emigrated from Ireland in the latter part of the eighteenth century and
settled not far from Cowantown in the Fourth district. His son John, the
father of the subject of this sketch, was born in Ireland, but was quite
young when his father came to this country.
</p>

<p class="prose">
David, the subject of this sketch, was born quite near to what was
formerly known as Dysart&#8217;s Tavern, now Appleton, on the 2nd of
September, 1817, and died near Cowantown, on the 14th of November, 1885.
</p>

<p class="prose">
All his life was spent within about two miles of the place of his birth,
and most of it on the Big Elk creek at what was known while he owned
them, as &#8220;Scott&#8217;s Mills.&#8221; His early life was devoted
to farming, but upon reaching the proper age he learned the trade of
augermaking, which at that time was one of the leading industries of
this county, and at which he soon became an expert workman, as well as a
skilful worker in iron and steel. The editor of this book has heard him
remark that when he could find no one else capable of making odd pieces
of ironwork for the machinery in his mills he would take the hammer and
make them himself, and has also seen him make and temper the knives for
a spoke machine which he used for a time in his bending mill.
</p>

<p class="prose">
He and the late Palmer C. Ricketts were intimate friends in boyhood and
remained such during the lifetime of Mr. Ricketts. Mr. Ricketts being of
a literary turn of mind, their friendship probably had much to do with
forming the literary tastes and shaping the political opinions of Mr.
Scott.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Scott was originally a Democrat, and when only about 23 years of age
is said to have aspired to a seat in the General Assembly of his native
State. But the leaders of the party failed to recognize his claims, and
he shortly afterwards was instrumental in the formation of the first
politico temperance organization in this county, and ran for the House
of Delegates on the first temperance ticket placed before the people in
1845. For a few years afterwards he took no part in politics, his whole
time and talents being engrossed in business, but in 1853 at the
solicitation of his friend Ricketts, he consented to be a candidate for
County Commissioner, and succeeded in carrying the Fourth district in
which he lived, which was then known as the Gibraltar of Democracy, by a
small majority, and securing his election by a majority of one vote over
Griffith M. Eldredge, his highest competitor on the Democratic ticket.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1855 he ran on the American ticket, with the late Samuel Miller and
Dr. Slater B. Stubbs, for the House of Delegates, and was elected by a
handsome majority.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1859 Mr. Scott consented to run on the American ticket for the State
Senate. His competitor was the late Joseph J. Heckart, who was elected.
This was a memorable campaign on account of the effect produced by the
John Brown raid upon the State of Virginia and the capture of Harper&#8217;s
Ferry, which had a disastrous effect upon Mr. Scott&#8217;s prospects, owing
probably to which he was defeated.
</p>

<p class="prose">
At the outbreaking of the war of the rebellion he espoused the Union
cause and gave it his hearty support during the continuance of the
struggle, and remained a consistent Republican until his death.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1864 he was a delegate to represent Cecil county in the
Constitutional Convention, his colleagues being Thomas P. Jones, George
Earle and the late Joseph B. Pugh. He was assigned to a place upon the
Committee on the Elective Franchise and had more to do with originating
that section of the Constitution which provided for the passage of a
registration law than any other person on the committee&#8212;probably
more than any other member of the Convention. He was an intimate friend
of Henry H. Goldsborough, whom he had previously nominated in the
Republican State Convention for the office of Comptroller of the State
Treasury, which office he still held, and whom Mr. Scott also nominated
for President of the Constitutional Convention in the Republican caucus,
and, as was very natural, was often called upon by Mr. Goldsborough to
preside over the Convention in his absence, which he did with that
<i>suaviter in modo</i> and <i>fortiter in re</i> for which he was
remarkable and with great acceptability to the members of both political
parties.
</p>

<p class="prose">
During the invasion of the State in July, 1864, he was one of the most
active members in urging upon the loyalists of Annapolis and the
military authorities in that city and at Camp Parole the necessity of
defending the Capital of the State. He held the handles of the plow with
which the first furrow that marked the line of the fortifications around
the city was made. It may not be out of place to say that the editor of
this book, in company with Mr. Scott, walked along the line of the ditch
the morning before, and that the former walked ahead of the team
attached to the plow so that the person who led the team might know
where to go.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Scott was also one of about a dozen members who remained in
Annapolis for about two weeks, during much of which time the arrival of
the rebel raiders was hourly expected, and kept the Convention alive by
adjourning from day to day, without which, by the rules adopted for the
government of the Convention, it could not have maintained a legal
existence.
</p>

<p class="prose">
He was appointed School Commissioner in 1882, which office he filled
with great acceptability to the public until incapacitated by the
disease which terminated his life.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Scott, though one of the most amiable of men, was fond of argument
when properly conducted, and from the time he was twenty years of age
until nearly the close of his life was always ready to participate in a
debate if he could find any person to oppose him; and thought it no
hardship to walk any where within a radius of four or five miles, in the
coldest weather, in order to attend a debating society. He was possessed
of a large and varied stock of information and a very retentive memory,
which enabled him to quote correctly nearly everything of importance
with which he had ever been familiar. His ability in this direction,
coupled with a keen sense of the ridiculous and satirical, rendered him
an opponent with whom few debaters were able to successfully contend.
But it was as a companion, a friend and a poet that he was best known
among the people of his neighborhood, to which his genial character and
kind and amiable disposition greatly endeared him.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Scott began to write poetry when about twenty-one years of age, and
continued to do so, though sometimes at long intervals, until a short
time before his death. His early poems were printed in &#8220;The Cecil Whig,&#8221;
but being published anonymously cannot be identified. Like many others,
he did not preserve his writings, and a few of his best poems have been
lost. Of his poetic ability and religious belief, we do not care to
speak, but prefer that the reader should form his own judgment of them
from the data derived from a perusal of his poems.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1844, Mr. Scott married Miss Agatha R. Fulton, a most estimable lady,
who, with their son Howard Scott and daughter Miss Annie Mary Scott,
survive him.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In conclusion, the editor thinks it not improper to say that he enjoyed
the pleasure of Mr. Scott&#8217;s intimate friendship for nearly thirty years,
and esteemed him as his best and most intimate friend. And that while
his friend was only mortal, and subject to mortal frailities, he had a
kind and generous heart; a soul which shrank from even the semblance of
meanness, and was the embodiment of every trait which ennobles and
elevates humanity.

Sing on, sweet feathered warbler, sing!<br />

Thou art the only sign of spring<br />

<p class="stanza">
The earth is buried deep in snow;<br />
The muffled streams refuse to flow,<br />
The rattling mill can scarcely go,<br />

The beauty of the vale below<br />
<span class="il3">In death is lost.</span>

<p class="stanza">
Save thine, no note of joy is heard&#8212;<br />
Thy kindred songsters of the wood<br />

A faithful friend, whose every word<br />

But Spring will come, as thou wilt see,<br />

<p class="stanza">
A Persian lady we&#8217;re informed&#8212;<br />
<span class="il1">This happened long, long years before</span><br />
The Christian era ever dawned,<br />
<span class="il1">A thousand years, it may be more,</span><br />
The date and narrative are so obscure,<br />
I have to guess some things that should be sure.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
I&#8217;m puzzled with this history,<br />
<span class="il1">And rue that I began the tale;</span><br />
It seems a kind of mystery&#8212;<br />
<span class="il1">I&#8217;m very much afraid I&#8217;ll fail,</span><br />
For want of facts of the sensation kind:<br />
I therefore dwell upon the few I find.

<p class="stanza">
I like voluminous writing best,<br />
<span class="il1">That gives the facts dress&#8217;d up in style.</span><br />
A handsome woman when she&#8217;s dressed<br />

<p class="stanza">
The story is a Grecian one,<br />
<span class="il1">The author&#8217;s name I cannot tell;</span><br />
Perhaps it was old Xenophon<br />
<span class="il1">Or Aristotle, I can&#8217;t dwell</span><br />
On trifles; perhaps Plutarch wrote the story:<br />
At any rate its years have made it hoary.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
The Greeks were famous in those days<br />
<span class="il1">In arts, in letters and in arms;</span><br />
Quite plain and simple in their ways;<br />
<span class="il1">With their own hands they tilled their farms;</span><br />
Some dressed the vine, some plow&#8217;d the ocean&#8217;s wave;<br />

Thermopyl&#230;, so famed in Grecian story<br />
Is but another name for martial glory.

<p class="stanza">
A busy hive to work or fight,<br />

And when for right they drew the sword, we know,<br />

</p>

<p class="stanza">
To me it is a painful sight<br />
<span class="il1">To see a nation great and good</span><br />

<p class="stanza">
The Persians were a gaudy race,<br />
<span class="il1">Much giv&#8217;n to dress and grand display;</span><br />
I&#8217;m grieved to note this is the case<br />

The dame in question was a type<br />
<span class="il1">Of all her class; handsome and rich</span><br />
And proud, of course, and flashing like<br />

She was, in fact a moving mass of light<br />
From jewels which outshone the stars at night.

To find one syllable about her size,<br />
The color of her hair, or of her eyes.

<h3 class="subtitle">Or The Farmer&#8217;s Appeal From a Jackass to the Mayor.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="prose">
The following poem grew out of a misunderstanding between Mr. Scott and
the clerk of the Wilmington market. In the winter of 1868, Mr. Scott was
in the habit of selling hominy in the market, and the clerk treated him
rudely and caused him to leave his usual stand and remove to another
one. From this arbitrary exercise of power Mr. Scott appealed to the
Mayor, who reinstated him in his old place. Mr. Scott soon afterwards
had several hundred of the poems printed and scattered them throughout
the market. In an introductory note he says, &#8220;the lines referring
to Mayor Valentine are intended as a compliment to that officer, as well
as a play on his official title of Mayor.&#8221;

Dear friends and neighbors, one and all,<br />

<span class="il1">Thus early in the year.</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
That time flies rapidly along,<br />
<span class="il1">And hurries us away,</span><br />
Has been the theme of many a song,<br />
<span class="il1">And it is mine to-day.</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
I stand where in my childhood&#8217;s days,<br />
<span class="il1">I often stood before,</span><br />
But nothing meets my altered gaze<br />
<span class="il1">As in the days of yore.</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
The trees I climbed in youthful glee,<br />
<span class="il1">Or slept beneath their shade.</span><br />
Have disappeared&#8212;no trace I see<br />
<span class="il1">Of them upon the glade.</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
The school house, too, which stood near by,<br />
<span class="il1">Has long since ceased to be;</span><br />
To find its site I often try,<br />
<span class="il1">No trace of it I see.</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
The road I traveled to and fro,<br />
<span class="il1">With nimble feet and spry,</span><br />
I cannot find, but well I know<br />
<span class="il1">It must have been hard by.</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
The pond where skating once I fell<br />
<span class="il1">Upon the ice so hard&#8212;</span><br />
I lost my senses for a spell,<br />
<span class="il1">And hence became a bard&#8212;</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
Is dry land now where grain or grass<br />
<span class="il1">Is growing year by year;</span><br />
I see the spot, as oft I pass,<br />
<span class="il1">No ice nor pond is there.</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
A barn is standing on the spot<br />
<span class="il1">Where once the school house stood;</span><br />
A dwelling on the playground lot,<br />
<span class="il1">A cornfield in the wood.</span>

I mourn not for these altered scenes,<br />

In early youth some found their graves,<br />

</p>

<p class="stanza">
A few survive, both far and near,<br />
<span class="il1">But O! how changed are they!</span><br />
Like the small band assembled here,<br />
<span class="il1">Enfeebled, old, and gray.</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
Strange feelings rise within my soul,<br />
<span class="il1">My eyes o&#8217;erflow with tears,</span><br />
As backward I attempt to roll<br />
<span class="il1">The flood of by-gone years.</span>

This honored pair we come to greet,<br />
<span class="il1">For five-and-forty years</span><br />

The heat and burden of the day<br />

In all the ups and downs of life&#8212;<br />

They never knew domestic strife,<br />

<p class="stanza">
They now seem standing on the verge<br />
<span class="il1">Of that unfathomed sea,</span><br />
Just waiting for the final surge<br />
<span class="il1">That opes eternity.</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
When comes that surge, or soon or late,<br />
<span class="il1">May they in peace depart;</span><br />

The rolling seasons come and go,<br />
As ebbs the tide again to flow,<br />

While we like straws upon a stream,<br />

To that unknown, that untried shore,<br />
Where days and nights will be no more,<br />

Absorbed in vast eternity.<br />
Where then shall we poor mortals go?<br />
No man can tell, we only know<br />
We are but strangers in the land.<br />
Our fathers all have gone before,<br />
And shortly we shall be no more.<br />
This hall where we so often meet<br />
Will soon be trod by other&#8217;s feet,<br />
And where our voices now resound,<br />
Will other speakers soon be found.<br />
And thus like wave pursuing wave,<br />
Between the cradle and the grave<br />
The human tide is prone to run,<br />
The sire succeeded by the son.<br />
May we so spend life&#8217;s fleeting day,<br />

<h4>The Peterson Genealogical Tree.</h4>

<p class="stanza">
I&#8217;ll sing you a song of a wonderful tree,<br />
Whose beauty and strength are a marvel to me;<br />
Its cloud piercing branches ascend to the sky,<br />
While its deep rooted trunk may the tempest defy,<br />
Like the tree which the great king of Babylon saw,<br />
Which fill&#8217;d him with wonder, amazement and awe.<br />
This vision the wise men all failed to expound,<br />
Till Daniel the Hebrew, its true meaning found.<br />
What the king saw in vision, we lit&#8217;rally see,<br />
In the Peterson genealogical tree;<br />
It was feeble at first, and slowly it grew;<br />
Its roots being small and its branches but few.<br />
The whirlwinds and tempests in fury raved round it,<br />
And the rains fell in floods, as if they would drown it.<br />
Though slow in its growth it was steady and sure,<br />
And like plants of slow growth &#8217;tis bound to endure.<br />
While the seasons roll round in their wanted succession,<br />
And the ages move on in an endless procession,<br />
While the sun in its glory reigns over the day,<br />
And the moon rules the night with her gentler sway,<br />
While the planets their courses pursue in the sky,<br />
And far distant stars light their torches on high,<br />
May this family tree grow taller and stronger<br />
And its branches increase growing longer and longer.<br />
May every branch of this vigorous tree,<br />
Increase and spread wider from mountain to sea,<br />
And under its shade may the poor and distressed<br />
Find shelter and comfort and kindness and rest,<br />
And when the great harvest we read of shall come<br />
When the angels shall gather and carry it home<br />
May this tree root and branch, trunk and fruit all be found,<br />
Transplanted from earth into holier ground,<br />
Where storms never rise and where frosts never blight,<br />
Where day ever shines unsucceeded by night,<br />
Where sickness and sorrow and death are no more,<br />
And friends never part. On that beautiful shore,<br />
May we hope that the friends who have met round this board,<br />
And greeted each other in social accord,<br />
May each meet the others to part never more.

<p class="stanza">
How are you, George, my rhyming brother?<br />
We should be kinder to each other,<br />
For we are kindred souls at least;<br />
I don&#8217;t mean kindred, like the beast,&#8212;<br />
Mere blood and bones and flesh and matter,&#8212;<br />
But what this last is makes no matter.<br />
Philosophers have tried to teach it,<br />
But all their learning cannot reach it;<br />
&#8217;Tis matter still, &#8220;that&#8217;s what&#8217;s the matter&#8221;<br />
With all their philosophic chatter,<br />
And Latin, Greek, and Hebrew clatter,<br />
Crucibles, retorts, and receivers,<br />
Wedges, inclined planes, and levers,<br />
Screws, blow pipes, electricity and light,<br />
And fifty other notions, quite<br />
Too much to either read or write.<br />
Just ask the wisest, What is matter?<br />
And notice how he will bespatter<br />
The subject, in his vain endeavor,<br />
With deep philosophy so clever,<br />
To prove you what you knew before,<br />
That matter&#8217;s matter, and no more.<br />
Well, this much then, we know at least,<br />
That matter&#8217;s substance, and the beast<br />
And bird and fish and creeping thing<br />
That moves on foot, with fin or wing,<br />
Is matter, just like you and me.<br />
Are they our kindred? Must it be<br />
That all the fools in all creation,<br />
And knaves and thieves of every station<br />
In life, can call me their relation?<br />
But that&#8217;s not all&#8212;the horse I ride,<br />
The ox I yoke, the dog I chide,<br />
The flesh and fish and fowl we feed on<br />
Are kindred, too; is that agreed on?<br />
Then kindred blood I quite disown,<br />
Though it descended from a throne,<br />
For it connects us down, also,<br />
With everything that&#8217;s mean and low&#8212;<br />
Insects and reptiles, foul and clean,<br />
And men a thousand times more mean.<br />
Let&#8217;s hear no more of noble blood,<br />
For noble brains, or actions good,<br />
Are only marks of true nobility.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
The kindred which I claim with you,<br />
Connects us with the just and true,<br />
And great in purpose, heart and soul,<br />
And makes us parts of that great whole<br />
Whose bonds of all embracing love<br />
A golden chain will ever prove<br />
To bind us to the good above.<br />
Then strive to elevate mankind<br />
By operating on the mind;<br />
The empire of good will extend,<br />
A helping hand in trouble lend,<br />
Go to thy brother in distress,<br />
One kindly word may make it less,<br />
A single word, when fitly spoken,<br />
May heal a heart with sorrow broken,<br />
A smile may overcome your foe,<br />
And make his heart with friendship glow,<br />
A frown might turn his heart to steel.<br />
And all its tendencies congeal,<br />
Be it our constant aim to cure<br />
The woes our fellow men endure,<br />
Teach them to act toward each other<br />
As they would act toward a brother.<br />
Thus may our circle wider grow,<br />
The golden chain still brighter glow;<br />
And may our kindred souls, in love<br />
United live, here and above,<br />
With all the good and wise and pure,<br />
While endless ages shall endure.

<h3 class="subtitle">Of the Jackson Hall Debating Society, Dec. 5, 1877.</h3>

<p class="stanza">
My muse inspire me, while I tell<br />
The weighty matters that befell<br />
On Monday night at Jackson Hall<br />
December fifth. I&#8217;ll tell it all,<br />
Day and year I&#8217;ll tell you even,<br />
&#8217;Twas eighteen hundred seventy-seven.<br />
The Jacksonites were out in force,<br />
No common thing was up of course,<br />
But something rare and rich and great,<br />
&#8217;Twas nothing short of a debate;<br />
What was the question? Let me see,<br />
Yes; &#8220;Can Christians consistently<br />
Engage in war against a brother<br />
And at the same time love each other?&#8221;<br />
But first and foremost let me say,<br />
My muse has taken me astray,<br />
So I&#8217;ll return to the beginning<br />
Digression is my common sinning<br />
For which your pardon I implore,<br />
If granted, I will sin no more,<br />
That is no more till the next time,<br />
For when I&#8217;m forging out a rhyme,<br />
The narrative which I would fix up,<br />
I somehow rather oddly mix up.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
A president must first be got,<br />
So they elected James M. Scott,<br />
He said he&#8217;d serve; (and that was clever,)<br />
A little while, but not forever.<br />
A paper called a &#8220;constitution,&#8221;<br />
Was read and on some person&#8217;s motion,<br />
Was all adopted, at a word,<br />
A thing that seemed to me absurd.<br />
Then instantly to work they went,<br />
And filled the chair of president,<br />
And William Henderson they took,<br />
They knew their man just like a book.<br />
A scribe was wanted next to keep,<br />
A record of their doings deep.<br />
On looking round they cast the lot,<br />
And so it fell on David Scott.<br />
A treasurer was next in order<br />
When looking up and down the border,<br />
For one to hoard the gold and silver,<br />
The mantle fell on Joseph Miller.<br />
The executive committee<br />
Was now to fill and here we see<br />
A piece of work I apprehend,<br />
May lead to trouble in the end,<br />
For while they only wanted five,<br />
Yet six they got, as I&#8217;m alive,<br />
First they installed Peter Jaquett,<br />
Then John Creswell, two men well met,<br />
James Law, but they were not enough,<br />
And so they added William Tuft.<br />
One more was wanted that was plain,<br />
That one was found in John McKane,<br />
But when the five were call&#8217;d to meet<br />
There were but four came to the seat;<br />
There are but four, said one so racy,<br />
So they elected William Gracy.<br />
Now you perceive this grave committee<br />
Which numbers five both wise and witty,<br />
Has got into a pretty fix<br />
With but five seats and numbers six.<br />
The question for the next debate<br />
Was then selected, which I&#8217;ll state<br />
If I have only got the gumption<br />
To make some word rhyme with resumption,<br />
&#8220;Should Congress now repeal the act<br />
To pay all debts in gold in fact.&#8221;
</p>

<p class="stanza">
The speakers now were trotted out<br />
Their sides to choose and take a bout<br />
Upon the question, which I stated<br />
As having been so well debated,<br />
Namely, &#8220;Can christians go to war,&#8221;<br />
The very devil might abhor<br />
To contemplate this proposition<br />
Offspring of pride and superstition<br />
That brothers by a second birth,<br />
Should make a very hell of earth.<br />
The war of words waxed loud and long,<br />
Each side was right, the other wrong;<br />
The speakers eager for the fray,<br />
Wished their ten minutes half a day;<br />
But time and tide will wait for none,<br />
So glibly did the gabble run,<br />
That nine o&#8217;clock soon spoiled the fun,<br />
And all that rising tide of words,<br />
Was smothered never to be heard.<br />
The fight is o&#8217;er, the race is run,<br />
And soon we&#8217;ll know which side has won,<br />
But this is not so easy done;<br />
Indeed I have a world of pity<br />
For the executive committee<br />
Who hear in silence all this clatter<br />
And then decide upon the matter;<br />
To give each speaker justice due,<br />
And sift the error from the true,<br />
Is not an easy thing to do.<br />
To decide what facts have any bearing<br />
Upon the question they are hearing,<br />
And generally keep in hand<br />
The arguments, so strong and grand,<br />
And draw from them a just conclusion<br />
Without a mixture of confusion;<br />
The negative got the decision<br />
Unanimous, without division.<br />
The speakers then took their position,<br />
Upon the doubtful proposition<br />
Of the repeal of gold resumption,<br />
Upon the plausible presumption,<br />
That those who pay must have the money,<br />
That laws of Congress, (that seems funny,)<br />
Are not above the laws of trade,<br />
And therefore cannot be obeyed.<br />
Here now my muse, poor worthless jade,<br />
Deserted, as I was afraid<br />
From the beginning she would do;<br />
So I must say good-night to you,<br />
And these long rambling minutes close,<br />
In just the dullest kind of prose.

Fleeting time is on the wing&#8212;<br />
Surely Winter, joyous Spring,<br />
Glowing Summer, Autumn sere,<br />

Late the earth was green and fair,<br />
Flowers were blooming everywhere;<br />
Birds were singing in the trees,<br />
While the balmy healthful breeze,<br />
Laden with perfume and song,<br />
Health and beauty flowed along.

<p class="stanza">
But a change comes o&#8217;er the scene;<br />
Still the fields and trees are green,<br />

Strips the shoes from little feet,<br />
And the coats from little backs;<br />
While the paddling bare-foot tracks,<br />
In the brooklet which I see,<br />
Tell of youthful sports and glee.<br />
Hay is rip&#8217;ning on the plain,<br />
Fields are rich in golden grain,<br />
Mowers rattle sharp and shrill,<br />
Reapers echo from the hill,<br />
Farmer, dark and brown with heat,<br />
Push your labor&#8212;it is sweet,<br />

And sow, you are reaping now.<br />
Corn, which late, was scarcely seen,<br />

How like magic it does grow;<br />
Rising to majestic height,<br />
Drinks the sunbeams with delight,<br />
Sends its rootlets through the soil,<br />
Foraging for hidden spoil;<br />
Riches more than golden ore,<br />
Silent workers they explore:<br />
With their apparatus small,<br />
Noiselessly they gather all.<br />
When their work is done, behold<br />
Treasures, richer far than gold,<br />
Fill the farmers store-house wide&#8212;<br />
And his grateful soul beside.

<p class="stanza">
But the scene must change again,<br />
Hill and dell and spreading plain,<br />

Summer&#8217;s reign is at an end.<br />
Forests, gorgeously arrayed,<br />
(Queens such dresses ne&#8217;er displayed)<br />
Grace the coronation scene<br />
Of the lovely Autumn queen.<br />
Birds, with multifarious notes,<br />
Ringing from ten thousand throats,<br />
Shout aloud that Summer&#8217;s dead,<br />
And Autumn reigns in her stead.<br />
Now another change behold&#8212;<br />
All the varied tints of gold,<br />
Purple, crimson, orange, green&#8212;<br />
Every hue and shade between,<br />
That bedecked the forest trees,<br />
Now lie scattered by the breeze.<br />
The birds have flown. Faithless friends<br />
Love the most when they&#8217;re best fed;<br />
And when they have gained their ends,<br />
Shamefully have turned and fled.<br />
Winter claims his wide domain,<br />
And begins his frigid reign.<br />
Thus the seasons come and go:<br />
Spring gives place to Summer&#8217;s glow;<br />
Then comes mellow Autumn&#8217;s sway,<br />
Rip&#8217;ning fruits and short&#8217;ning day;<br />
Gorgeous woods in crimson dress,<br />
Surpassing queens in loveliness.<br />
Then the Frost King mounts the throne,<br />
Claims the empire for his own;<br />
Hail and rain and sleet and snow<br />
Are his ministers that go<br />
On the swift wings of the blast,<br />
At his bidding, fierce and fast.

Flew my kite from hill to hill;<br />

Childish joys, I know them all.<br />
Childish sorrows, too I&#8217;ve felt&#8212;<br />

Mysteries then confused my brain,<br />

Much that then seemed plain and clear<br />
Has grown darker year by year;<br />
When my artless prayers I said,<br />
Skies were near&#8212;just over head;<br />
And the angels seemed so near,<br />
I could whisper in their ear.<br />
All that I have learned since then,<br />
I would give, if once again,<br />
Those bright visions would return.<br />
For I find, the more I learn,<br />
Further off the skies appear,<br />
And the angels come not near.<br />
Though in better words I pray,<br />
Heaven seems so far away,<br />
That I wish, but wish in vain,<br />
That the skies were near again;<br />
That no other words I knew,<br />
But those simple ones and few,<br />
That the angels used to hear,<br />
When I whispered in their ear.<br />
I would barter all the fame,<br />
Wealth and learning that I claim,<br />
Which a life of toil have cost,<br />
For those priceless seasons lost.

<h1><a id="b-a" name="b-a">Emma Alice Browne.</a></h1>


<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">Emma Alice Browne</span> was born about forty-five years ago, in an
unpretentious cottage, which is still standing near the northeast corner
of the cross-roads, on the top of Mount Pleasant, or Vinegar Hill, as it
was then called, about a mile west of Colora. She is the oldest child of
William A. Browne and Hester A. Touchstone, sister of the late James
Touchstone. Her father was the youngest son of William Brown, who
married Ann Spear, of Chester county, and settled a few yards north of
the State Line, in what is now Lewisville, Chester county, Pennsylvania,
where his son William was born, early in the present century. He was a
stonemason by trade, and though comparatively uneducated, was possessed
of a brilliant imagination, and so highly endowed by nature with poetic
ability that he frequently amused and delighted his fellow-workmen by
singing songs which he extemporized while at his work. There is no doubt
that his granddaughter, the subject of this sketch, inherited much of
her poetic talent from him; though her family is connected with that of
Mrs. Felicia Hemans, the English poetess, whom though in some respects
she resembles, we hesitate not to say she greatly surpasses in grandeur
of conception and beauty of expression.
</p>

<p class="prose">
William Brown was a half-brother of the mother of the editor of this
book; consequently Emma and he are cousins. If, therefore, this sketch
should seem to exceed or fall short of the truth, the reader must
attribute its imperfections to the inability of the writer to do justice
to the subject, or to the great, but he hopes pardonable, admiration
which he has long entertained for his relative&#8217;s literary productions.
</p>

<p class="prose">
The Brown family are of Scotch-Irish extraction, and trace their lineage
away back through a long line of ancestors to the time when the name was
spelled Brawn, because of the great muscular development of the rugged
old Scotch Highlander who founded it.
</p>

<p class="prose">
William Brown&#8217;s early education was obtained at the common schools of
the neighborhood where he was born. He was endowed by nature with a
logical mind, a vivid imagination and great practical common sense; and
a memory so tenacious as to enable him to repeat a sermon almost, if not
quite, verbatim, a year after he had heard it delivered. Early in life
he became an exemplary member of the Methodist Church, and was ordained
as a Local Preacher in the Methodist Protestant persuasion, by the Rev.
John G. Wilson, very early in the history of that denomination, in the
old Harmony Church, not far south of Rowlandville. Subsequently he was
admitted to the Conference as a traveling minister and sent to
southeastern Pennsylvania, where he continued to preach the gospel with
much success until his death, which occurred when his daughter Emma was
a child about eight years of age.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Emma&#8217;s education began on her father&#8217;s knee, when she was little if any
more than three years old. Before she was four years old she could
repeat Anacreon&#8217;s Ode to a Grasshopper, which her father had learned
from a quaint old volume of heathen mythology, and taught his little
daughter to repeat, by reciting it aloud to her, as she sat upon his
knee. Subsequently, and before she had learned to read, he taught her in
the same manner &#8220;Byron&#8217;s Apostrophe to the Ocean,&#8221; Campbell&#8217;s &#8220;Battle of
Hohenlinden,&#8221; and Byron&#8217;s &#8220;Destruction of Sennacherib,&#8221; all of which
seem to have made a deep impression upon her infantile mind,
particularly the latter, in speaking of which she characterizes it as &#8220;a
poem whose barbaric glitter and splendor captivated my imagination even
at that early period, and fired my fancy with wild visions of Oriental
magnificence and sublimity, so that I believe all my after life caught
color and warmth and form from those early impressions of the gorgeous
word-painting of the East.&#8221; Emma&#8217;s subsequent education was limited to a
few weeks&#8217; attendance at a young ladies&#8217; seminary at West Chester,
Pennsylvania, and a like experience of a few weeks in Wilmington,
Delaware, when she was about sixteen years old. But her mind was so full
of poesy that there was no room in it for ordinary matters and things,
and the duties of a student soon became so irksome that she left both
the institutions in disgust. Of her it may be truly said, &#8220;she lisp&#8217;d in
numbers, for the numbers came,&#8221; for she composed verses at four years of
age, and published poems at ten. Her first effusions appeared in a local
paper at Reading, Pa. Being a born poetess, her success as a writer was
assured from the first, and her warmth of expression and richness of
imagery, combined with a curious quaintness, the outgrowth of the deep
vein of mysticism that pervades her nature, soon attracted the attention
of the <i>literati</i> of this country, one of the most distinguished of
whom, the late George D. Prentice, did not hesitate to pronounce her the
most extraordinary woman of America; &#8220;for,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if she can&#8217;t find
a word to suit her purpose, she makes one.&#8221; While some of her earlier
poems may have lacked the artistic finish and depth of meaning of those
of mature years, they had a beauty and freshness peculiar to themselves,
which captivated the minds and rarely failed to make a deep impression
upon the hearts of those who read them.

In 1855, the family came to Port Deposit, where they remained about two
years, and then went West, Emma having secured a good paying position on
the <i>Missouri Republican</i>, for which she wrote her only continued story,
&#8220;Not Wanted.&#8221; For the last twenty years she has been a regular
contributor to the <i>New York Ledger</i>.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1864, Emma came East and was married to Captain J. Lewis Beaver, of
Carroll county, Maryland, whose acquaintance she made while he was a
wounded invalid in the Naval School Hospital at Annapolis. After her
marriage, she continued to write under her maiden name, and has always
been known in the literary world as Emma Alice Browne, though all the
rest of the family spell the name without the final vowel. Her marriage
was not a fortunate one, and the writer in deference to the wishes of
his relative, will only say she is now a widow, with three sons, the
youngest of whom seems to have inherited much of his mother&#8217;s poetic
talent, and who, though only about ten years of age, has written some
very creditable verses, which have been published.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Within a year or two, Emma has developed a talent for painting, which
seems to have been overshadowed and dwarfed by her poetic faculty, but
which now bids fair to make her as famous as an artist as she has long
been as a poetess. She resides in Danville, Illinois, and is about
publishing a volume of poems, which will be the first book from her pen.

The following selections have been made with the view of showing the
versatility, rather than the poetic beauty and power of their author.
Most, if not all, of those designated as earlier poems were written more
than thirty years ago.

On the morning when cruel Sir Spencer<br />

Therefore the haughty Earl Spencer<br />

My memory paints her sweetly meek,<br />

No cluster purpled on the vine,<br />
No blossom made the furrows shine<br />
With hints of harvest anywhere!<br />
Ben Hafed, scorning to complain,<br />
Bent to his thankless toil again:<br />
&#8220;I slight no task I find to do,<br />
Dear Lord, and if my sheaves be few,<br />
Thou wilt not count my labor vain?&#8221;
</p>

<p class="stanza">
His neighbors, rich in flocks and lands,<br />
Stood by and mocked his empty hands:<br />
&#8220;Why wage with ceaseless fret and toil<br />
The grim warfare that yields no spoil?<br />
Why spend thy zest on barren sands?<br />
The circling seasons come and go,<br />
And others garner as they sow;<br />
But year by year, in sun and rain,<br />
Thou till&#8217;st these fields with toil and pain,<br />
Where only tares and thistles grow!&#8221;
</p>

<p class="stanza">
With quiet mien Ben Hafed heard,<br />
And answered not by sign or word,<br />
Tho&#8217; some divine, all-trustful sense<br />
Of loss made sweet thro&#8217; recompense,<br />
In God&#8217;s good time, within him stirred.<br />
With no vain protest or lament,<br />
Low to the stubborn glebe he bent:<br />
&#8220;I till the fields Thou gavest me,<br />
And leave the harvest, Lord, to thee,&#8221;<br />
He said&#8212;and plodded on, content.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
And ever, with the golden seeds,<br />
He sowed an hundred gracious deeds&#8212;<br />
Some act of helpful charity,<br />
A saving word of cheer, may be,<br />
To some poor soul in bitter need!<br />
And life wore on from gold to gray;<br />
The world went by, another way:<br />
&#8220;Tho&#8217; long and wearisome my task,<br />
Dear Lord, &#8217;tis but a tithe I ask,<br />
And Thou will grant me that, some day!&#8221;
</p>

<p class="stanza">
One morn upon his humble bed,<br />
They found Ben Hafed lying dead,<br />
God&#8217;s light upon his worn old face,<br />
And God&#8217;s ineffable peace and grace<br />
Folding him round from feet to head.<br />
And lo! in cloudless sunshine rolled<br />
The glebe but late so bare and cold,<br />
Between fair rows of tree and vine<br />
Rich clustered, sweating oil and wine,<br />
Shone all in glorious harvest gold!
</p>

<p class="stanza">
And One whose face was strangely bright<br />
With loving ruth&#8212;whose garments white<br />
Were spotless as the lilies sweet<br />
That sprang beneath His shining feet&#8212;<br />
Moved slowly thro&#8217; those fields of light;<br />
&#8220;Blest be Ben Hafed&#8217;s work&#8212;thrice blest!&#8221;<br />
He said, and gathered to His breast<br />
The harvest sown in toil and tears:<br />
&#8220;Henceforth, thro&#8217; Mine eternal years,<br />
Thou, faithful servant, cease and rest!&#8221;

Now Cleo, fly round! Father&#8217;s going to town<br />
With a load o&#8217; red russets, to meet Captain Brown;<br />
The mortgage is due, and it&#8217;s got to be paid,<br />
And father is troubled to raise it, I&#8217;m &#8217;fraid!<br />
We&#8217;ve had a bad year, with the drouth and the blight<br />
The harvest was short, and the apple crop light;<br />
The early hay cutting scarce balanced the cost,<br />
And the heft o&#8217; the after-math&#8217;s ruined with frost;<br />
A gloomy Thanksgiving to-morrow will be&#8212;<br />
But the ways o&#8217; the Lord are not our ways, ah me!

<p class="stanza">
But His dear will be done! If we jest do our best,<br />
And trust Him, I guess He&#8217;ll take care o&#8217; the rest;<br />
I&#8217;d not mind the worry, nor stop to repine,<br />
Could I take father&#8217;s share o&#8217; the burden with mine!<br />
He is grieving, I know, tho&#8217; he says not a word,<br />
But, last night, &#8217;twixt the waking and dreaming, I heard<br />
The long, sobbing sighs of a strong man in pain,<br />
And I knew he was fretting for Robert again!<br />
Our Robert, our first-born: the comfort and stay<br />
Of our age, when we two should grow feeble and gray;<br />
What a baby he was! with his bright locks, and eyes<br />
Just as blue as a bit o&#8217; the midsummer skies!<br />
And in youth&#8212;why, it made one&#8217;s heart lightsome and glad<br />
Like a glimpse o&#8217; the sun, just to look at the lad!

<p class="stanza">
But the curse came upon him&#8212;the spell of unrest&#8212;<br />

We gave Rob our blessing, and jest let him go!

And the eggs, in this basket&#8212;ten dozen all told.<br />
Tell father be sure and remember the tea&#8212;<br />
And the spice and the yard o&#8217; green gingham for me;<br />
And the sugar for baking:&#8212;and ask him to go<br />
To the office&#8212;there might be a letter, you know!

<p class="stanza">
May Providence go with your father to town,<br />
And soften the heart o&#8217; this rich Captain Brown.<br />

Along with the mortgage that&#8217;s jest falling due,<br />
And that father allowed Archie Grace would renew;<br />
And, Cleo, I reckon that father will sell<br />
The Croft, and the little real Alderney, Bel.<br />
You raised her, I know; and it&#8217;s hard she must go;<br />
But father will pay every dollar we owe;<br />
It&#8217;s his way, to be honest and fair as the day;<br />
And he always was dreadfully set in his way.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
I try to find comfort in thinking, my dear,<br />
That things would be different if Robert was here;<br />
I guess he&#8217;d a stayed but for Archibald Grace.<br />
And helped with the chores and looked after the place;<br />
But Archie, he heard from that Eben Carew,<br />
And went wild to go off to the gold-diggings, too;<br />
And so they must up and meander out West,<br />
And now they are murdered&#8212;or missing, at best&#8212;<br />
Surprised by that bloody, marauding &#8220;Red Wing,&#8221;<br />
&#8217;Way out in the Yellowstone country, last spring.

No wonder, Cleora, I&#8217;m getting so gray!<br />

But I reckon I&#8217;ve guessed about Archie and you!<br />
And the Lord knows our burdens are grievous to bear,<br />
But there&#8217;s still a bright edge to my cloud of despair,<br />

Things were never so bad yet as things might a-been.<br />

<span class="il1">The heavy graded iron trail;</span><br />
But, inch by inch, the overflow<br />
Dragged down the road bed, till the slow<br />
<span class="il1">Back-water crept across the rail.</span><br />
And where the ghostly trestle spanned<br />
A stretch of marshy bottom-land,<br />
<span class="il1">The stealthy under current gnawed</span><br />
At sunken pile, and massive pier,<br />
And the stout bridge hung airily where<br />
<span class="il1">She sullen dyke lay deep and broad.</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
Above the hollow, droning sound<br />
Of waves that filled the watery round,<br />
<span class="il1">She heard a distant shout and din&#8212;</span><br />
The levees of the upper land<br />
Had crumbled like a wall of sand,<br />
<span class="il1">And the wild floods were pouring in!</span><br />
She saw the straining dyke give way&#8212;<br />
The quaking trestle reel and sway.<br />
<span class="il1">Yet hold together, bravely, still!</span><br />
She saw the rushing waters drown<br />
The piers, while ever sucking down<br />
<span class="il1">The undermined and treacherous &#8220;fill!&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
Her strong heart hammered in her breast,<br />
As o&#8217;er a distant woody crest<br />
<span class="il1">A dim gray plume of vapor trailed;</span><br />
And nearer, clearer, by and by,<br />
Like the faint echo of a cry,<br />
<span class="il1">A warning whistle shrilled and wailed!</span><br />
Her frightened gelding reared and plunged,<br />
As the doomed trestle rocked and lunged&#8212;<br />
<span class="il1">The keen lash scored his silken hide:</span><br />
&#8220;Come, Bayard! We must reach the bridge<br />
And cross to yonder higher ridge&#8212;<br />
<span class="il1">For thrice an hundred lives we ride!&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
She stooped and kissed his tawny mane,<br />
Sodden with flecks of froth and rain;<br />
<span class="il1">Then put him at the surging flood!</span><br />
Girth deep the dauntless gelding sank,<br />
The tide hissed round his smoking flank,<br />
<span class="il1">But straight for life or death she rode!</span><br />
The wide black heavens yawned again,<br />
Down came the torrent rushing rain&#8212;<br />
<span class="il1">The icy river clutched her!</span><br />
Shrill in her ears the waters sang,<br />
Strange fires from the abysses sprang,<br />
<span class="il1">The sharp sleet stung like whip and spur!</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
Her yellow hair, blown wild and wide,<br />
Streamed like a meteor o&#8217;er the tide;<br />
<span class="il1">Her set white face yet whiter grew,</span><br />
As lashed by furious flood and rain,<br />
Still for the bridge, with might and main,<br />
<span class="il1">Her gallant horse swam, straight and true!</span><br />
They gained the track, and slowly crept<br />
Timber by timber, torrents swept,<br />
<span class="il1">Across the boiling hell of water&#8212;</span><br />
Till past the torn and shuddering bridge<br />
He bore her to the safer ridge,<br />
<span class="il1">The engineer&#8217;s intrepid daughter!</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
The night was falling wild and black,<br />
The waters blotted out the track;<br />
<span class="il1">She gave her flying horse free rein,</span><br />
For full a dreadful mile away<br />
The lonely wayside station lay,<br />
And hoarse above his startled neigh<br />
<span class="il1">She heard the thunder of the train!</span><br />
&#8220;What if they meet this side the goal?&#8221;<br />
She thought with sick and shuddering soul;<br />
For well she knew what doom awaited<br />
A fell mischance&#8212;a step belated&#8212;<br />
The grinding wheels, the yawning dyke&#8212;<br />
Sure death for her&#8212;for them&#8212;alike!
</p>

<p class="stanza">
Like danger-lamps her blue eyes glowed,<br />
As thro&#8217; the whirling gloom she rode,<br />
<span class="il1">Her laboring breath drawn sharply in;</span><br />
Pitted against yon rushing wheels<br />
Were tireless grit and trusty heels,<br />
<span class="il1">And with God&#8217;s favor they might win!</span><br />
And soon along the perilous line<br />
Flamed out the lurid warning sign,<br />
While round her staggering horse the crowd<br />
Surged with wild cheers and plaudits loud.&#8212;<br />
And this is how, thro&#8217; flood and rain,<br />
Brave Kate McCarthy saved the train!

<h3 class="title"><a id="b-x" name="b-x">Off the Skidloe.</a></h3>

<p class="stanza">
With leagues of wasteful water ringed about,<br />
And wrapped in sheeted foam from base to peak,<br />
A sheer, stupendous monolith, wrought out<br />
By the slow, ceaseless labor of the deeps,<br />
In awful isolation, old as Time,<br />
The gray, forbidding Rock of Skidloe stands&#8212;<br />
Breasting the wild incursions of the North&#8212;<br />
The grim antagonist of a thousand waves!
</p>

<p class="stanza">
Far to the leeward, faintly drawn against<br />
A dim perspective of perpetual storms,<br />
A frowning line of black basaltic cliffs<br />
Baffles the savage onset of the surf.<br />
But, rolled in cloud and foam, old Skidloe lifts<br />
His dark, defiant head forever mid<br />
The shock and thunder of contending tides,<br />
And fixed, immovable as fate, hurls back<br />
The rude, eternal protest of the sea!
</p>

<p class="stanza">
Colossal waters coil about his feet,<br />
Deep rooted in the awful gulfs between<br />
The measureless walls of mountain chains submerged;<br />
An infinite hoarse murmur wells from all<br />
His dim mysterious crypts and corridors:<br />
The inarticulate mutterings that voice<br />
The ancient secret of the mighty main.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
In all the troubled round of sea and air,<br />
No glimpse of brightness lends the vivid zest<br />
Of life and light to the harsh monotone<br />
Of gray tumultuous flood and spectral sky;<br />
Far off the black basaltic crags are heaved<br />
Against the desolate emptiness of space;<br />
But no sweet beam of sunset ever falls<br />
Athwart old Skidloe&#8217;s cloudy crest&#8212;no soft<br />
And wistful glory of awakened dawn<br />
Lays on his haggard brows a touch of grace.<br />
Sometimes a lonely curlew skims across<br />
The seething torment of the dread abyss,<br />
And, shrieking, dips into the mist beyond;<br />
But, solitary and unchanged for aye,<br />
He towers amid the rude revolt of waves,<br />
His stony face seamed by a thousand years,<br />
And wrinkled with a million furrows, worn<br />
By the slow drip of briny tears, that creep<br />
Along his hollow cheek. His hidden hands<br />
Drag down the drowned and tossing wrecks that drive<br />
Before the fury of the Northern gales,<br />
And mute, inscrutable as destiny,<br />
He keeps his sombre secrets as of yore.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
The slow years come and go; the seasons dawn<br />
And fade, and pass to swell the solemn ranks<br />
Of august ages in the march of Time.<br />
But changeless still, amid eternal change,<br />
Old Skidloe bears the furious brunt of all<br />
The warring elements that grapple mid<br />
The mighty insurrections of the sea!<br />
Gray desolation, ancient solitude,<br />
Brood o&#8217;er his wide, unrestful water world,<br />
While grim, unmoved, forbidding as of yore,<br />
He wraps his kingly altitudes about<br />
With the fierce blazon of the thunder cloud;<br />
And on his awful and uplifted brows<br />
The red phylactery of the lightning shines;<br />
And throned amid eternal wars, he dwells,<br />
His dread regality hedged round by all<br />
The weird magnificence of exultant storms!

<h1><a id="c-a" name="c-a">Nathan Covington Brooks, A.M., LL.D.</a></h1>


<p class="prose">
The following sketch is principally from the Third Volume of
Biographical Sketches of Eminent Americans.
</p>

<p class="prose">
&#8220;<span class="bio-subject">Nathan Covington Brooks</span>, the youngest son of John and Mary Brooks, was
born in West Nottingham, Cecil county, Maryland, on the 12th of August,
1809. His education was commenced at the West Nottingham Academy, then
under the charge of Rev. James Magraw, D.D., and subsequently he
graduated as Master of Arts, at St. John&#8217;s College, Annapolis, Md. His
thesis was a poem on the World&#8217;s Changes. Diligent and persevering in
his studies, his rapid progress and high attainments won the regard of
his teachers, while his amiable manners endeared him to his classmates.
While his principal delight was in the study of the Classics, he devoted
much attention to mathematics and other studies. Like many other
writers, some of his earliest efforts were in verse. Indeed it may be
said of him, as of Pope, that he &#8216;lisped in rhyme.&#8217;
</p>

<p class="prose">
Though we have no Shakespeares, or Miltons, or Byrons, there is no
scarcity of literary amateurs who, in their hours of recreation and
dalliance with letters, betake themselves to poetry as an amusement for
their leisure hours or a solace amid the rude trials of life. High in
the rank of these writers of occasional poetry stands Dr. Brooks.
Nature, in all her forms, he has made the subject of close observation
and profound reflection, and in looking at Nature, he has used his own
eyes and not the spectacles of other writers. He has a keen relish for
the beautiful, and a deep sympathy with the truthful and the good. His
taste, formed on the finest models, has been ripened and chastened by a
patient study of the great monuments of antiquity. His thoughts seem to
be the natural development of his mind; and his words the unstudied
expression of his thoughts. The music of his verse reminds us sometimes
of the soft cadences of Hemans, and not unfrequently of the mournful
harp of Byron.&#8221;
</p>

<p class="prose">
In his eighteenth year he was a contributor of prose and poetry to the
<i>Minerva and Emerald</i>, and <i>Saturday Post</i>, of Baltimore; subsequently
contributed to <i>The Wreath</i>, <i>Monument</i>, <i>Athen&#230;um</i>, and <i>Protestant</i>,
of the same city. In 1830 he edited <i>The Amethyst</i>, an annual and soon
after became a contributor of prose and poetry to <i>Atkinson&#8217;s Casket</i>,
and <i>The Lady&#8217;s Book</i>, of which latter he was the first paid
contributor; wrote for <i>Burton&#8217;s Magazine</i>, and <i>Graham&#8217;s</i>, <i>The New
York Mirror</i>, <i>The Ladies&#8217; Companion</i>, and the <i>Home Journal</i>; and the
following annuals, <i>The Gift</i>, <i>The Christian Keepsake</i>, and <i>The
Religious Souvenir</i>. He contributed also prose and poetry to <i>The
Southern Literary Messenger</i>, <i>The Southern Quarterly</i> of New Orleans,
<i>The London Literary Gazette</i>, and <i>The London Court Journal</i>.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1837 Marshall, of Philadelphia, published a volume of his religious
poems, entitled &#8220;Scriptural Anthology.&#8221; In 1840, Kay Brothers, of
Philadelphia, published a volume of his prose and poetry, under the name
of &#8220;The Literary Amaranth.&#8221; Besides these Dr. Brooks has edited a series
of Greek and Latin classics, has written four volumes on religious
subjects, one on &#8220;Holy Week,&#8221; just issued from the press, &#8220;The History
of the Mexican War,&#8221; which was translated into German, &#8220;Battles of the
Revolution,&#8221; etc.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In his literary career he has won three prizes that will be cherished as
heirlooms in the family, a silver pitcher, for the best prose tale,
entitled &#8220;The Power of Truth,&#8221; and two silver goblets, one a prize for
the poem entitled &#8220;The Fall of Superstition,&#8221; the other a prize for a
poem, &#8220;The South-sea Islander,&#8221; for which fifteen of our leading poets
were competitors.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Though in his leisure moments Dr. Brooks has achieved so much in
literature, his profession has been that of an educator, in which he has
had the mental training of males and females to the number of five or
six thousand. In 1824, he was appointed to the village school in
Charlestown, Cecil county, in 1826, established a private school in
Baltimore city; in 1831 was elected principal of the Franklin Academy,
Reistertown, and in 1834 principal of the Brookesville Academy,
Montgomery county, both endowed by the State; in 1839, he was
unanimously elected over forty-five applicants as principal of the
Baltimore City High School which position he held for nine years, until
asked by the Trustees of the Baltimore Female College, in 1848, to
accept the organization of the institution. The College is chartered and
endowed by the State of Maryland, has graduated over three hundred young
ladies, and trained and sent forth two hundred teachers. Emory College,
Oxford, Georgia, conferred the degree of LL.D., on Professor Brooks in
1859, and in 1863 his name was presented, with others, for the
presidency of Girard College. Though Major Smith, a Philadelphian of an
influential family, was elected president, Professor Brooks received
more votes than any of the other competitors. In 1827, he married Mary
Elizabeth, eldest daughter of William Gobright, a lady of great beauty
and excellence, and in 1867, married Christiana Octavia, youngest
daughter of Dr. William Crump, of Virginia. Of the former union four
sons and two daughters are living; of the latter union a son. The
following poems are selected as specimens of his style.

<h3 class="title"><a id="c-b" name="c-b">The Mother to Her Dead Boy.</a></h3>

<p class="stanza">
The flowers you reared repose in sleep<br />
With folded bells where the night-dews weep,<br />
And the passing wind, like a spirit, grieves<br />
In a gentle dirge through the sighing leaves.<br />
The sun will kiss the dew from the rose,<br />
Its crimson petals again unclose,<br />
And the violet ope the soft blue ray<br />
Of its modest eye to the gaze of day;<br />
But when will the dews and shades that lie<br />
So cold and damp on thy shrouded eye,<br />
Be chased from the folded lids, my child,<br />
And thy glance break forth so sweetly wild?
</p>

<p class="stanza">
The fawn, thy partner in sportive play,<br />
Has ceased his gambols at close of day,<br />
And his weary limbs are relaxed and free<br />
In gentle sleep by his favorite tree.<br />
He will wake ere long, and the rosy dawn<br />
Will call him forth to the dewy lawn,<br />
And his sprightly gambols be seen again,<br />
Through the parted boughs and upon the plain;<br />
But oh! when will slumber cease to hold<br />
The limbs that lie so still and cold?<br />
When wilt thou come with thy tiny feet<br />
That bounded my glad embrace to meet?
</p>

<p class="stanza">
The birds you tended have ceased to sing,<br />
And shaded their eyes with the velvet wing,<br />
And, nestled among the leaves of the trees,<br />
They are rocked to rest by the cool night breeze.<br />
The morn will the chains of sleep unbind,<br />
And spread their plumes to the freshening wind;<br />
And music from many a warbler&#8217;s mouth<br />
Will honey the grove, like the breath of the south;<br />
But when shall the lips, whose lightest word<br />
Was sweeter far than the warbling bird,<br />
Their rich wild strain of melody pour?<br />
They are mute! they are cold! they will ope no more!
</p>

<p class="stanza">
When heaven&#8217;s great bell in a tone sublime<br />
Shall sound the knell of departed Time,<br />
And its echoes pierce with a voice profound<br />
Through the liquid sea and the solid ground,<br />
Thou wilt wake, my child, from the dreamless sleep<br />
Whose oblivious dews thy senses steep,<br />
And then will the eye, now dim, grow bright<br />
In the glorious rays of Heaven&#8217;s own light,<br />
The limbs, that an angel&#8217;s semblance bore,<br />
Bloom &#8217;neath living trees on the golden shore,<br />
And the voice that&#8217;s hushed, God&#8217;s praises hymn<br />
&#8217;Mid the bands of the harping seraphim.

<h3 class="title"><a id="c-c" name="c-c">To a Dove.</a></h3>

<h3 class="subtitle">Mourning amid the Ruins of an Ancient Church.</h3>

<p class="stanza">
The fields have faded, the groves look dead,<br />
The summer is gone, its beauty has fled,<br />
And there breathes a low and plaintive sound<br />
From each stream and solemn wood around.<br />
In unison with their tone, my breast<br />
With a spirit of kindred gloom is opprest,<br />
And the sighs burst forth as I gaze, the while,<br />
On the crumbling stone of the reverend pile,<br />
And list to the sounds of the moaning wind<br />
As it stirs the old ivy-boughs entwined,&#8212;<br />
Sighs mournful along through chancel and nave,<br />
And shakes the loose panel and architrave,<br />
While the mouldering branches and withered leaves<br />
Are rustling around the moss-grown eaves.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
But sadder than these, thou emblem of love,<br />
Thy moanings fall, disconsolate dove,<br />
In the solemn eve on my pensive ear,<br />
As the wailing sounds of a requiem drear,<br />
As coming from crumbling altar stone<br />
They are borne on the winds in a dirge-like tone,<br />
Like the plaintive voice of the broken-hearted<br />
O&#8217;er hopes betrayed and joys departed.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
Why dost thou pour thy sad complaint<br />
On the evening winds from a bosom faint?<br />
As if thou hadst come from the shoreless main<br />
Of a world submerged to the ark again,<br />
With a weary heart to lament and brood<br />
O&#8217;er the wide and voiceless solitude.<br />
Dost thou mourn that the gray and mouldering door<br />
Swings back to the reverent crowd no more?<br />
That the tall and waving grass defiles<br />
The well-worn flags of the crowdless aisles?<br />
That the wild fox barks, and the owlet screams<br />
Where the organ and choir pealed out their themes?
</p>

<p class="stanza">
Dost thou mourn, that from sacred desk the word<br />
Of life and truth is no longer heard?<br />
That the gentle shepherd, who to pasture bore<br />
His flock, has gone, to return no more?<br />
Dost thou mourn for the hoary-headed sage<br />
Who has sunk to the grave &#8217;neath the weight of age?<br />
For the vanquished pride of manhood&#8217;s bloom?<br />
For the light of youth quenched in the tomb?<br />
For the bridegroom&#8217;s fall? For the bride&#8217;s decay?<br />
That pastor and people have passed away,<br />
And the tears of night their graves bedew<br />
By the funeral cypress and solemn yew?
</p>

<p class="stanza">
Or dost thou mourn that the house of God<br />
Has ceased to be a divine abode?<br />
That the Holy Spirit, which erst did brood<br />
O&#8217;er the Son of Man by Jordan&#8217;s flood,<br />
In thine own pure form to the eye of sense,<br />
From its resting place has departed hence,<br />
And twitters the swallow, and wheels the bat<br />
O&#8217;er the mercy-seat where its presence sat?<br />
I have marked thy trembling breast, and heard<br />
With a heart responsive thy tones, sweet bird,<br />
And have mourned, like thee, of earth&#8217;s fairest things<br />
The blight and the loss&#8212;Oh! had I thy wings,<br />
From a world of woe to the realms of the blest<br />
I would flee away, and would be at rest.

O&#8217;er Gallia&#8217;s mounts and on Iona&#8217;s shore<br />
The Runic altars roll their smoke no more;<br />
Fled is the Druid from his ancient oak,<br />
His harp is mute&#8212;his magic circle broke;<br />
And Desolation mopes in Odin&#8217;s cells<br />
Where spirit-voices called to join the feast of shells.<br />
<span class="il1">O&#8217;er Indian plains and ocean-girdled isles</span><br />
With brow of beauty Truth serenely smiles;<br />
The nations bow, as light is shed abroad,<br />
And break their idols for the living God.<br />
Where purple streams from human victims run<br />
And votive flesh hangs quivering in the sun,<br />
Quenched are the pyres, as shines salvation&#8217;s star&#8212;<br />
Grim Juggernaut is trembling on his car<br />
And cries less frequent come from Ganges&#8217; waves<br />
Where infant forms sink into watery graves.<br />
Where heathen prayers flamed by the cocoa tree<br />
They supplicate the Christians&#8217; Deity<br />
And chant in living aisles the vesper hymn<br />
Where giant god-trees rear their temples dim.<br />
Still speed thy truth!&#8212;still wave thy spirit sword,<br />
Till every land acknowledge Thee the Lord,<br />
And the broad banner of the Cross, unfurled<br />
In triumph, wave above a subject world.<br />
And here O God! where feuds thy church divide&#8212;<br />
The sectary&#8217;s rancor, and the bigot&#8217;s pride&#8212;<br />
Melt every heart, till all our breasts enshrine<br />
One faith, one hope, one love, one zeal divine,<br />
And, with one voice, adoring nations call<br />
Upon the Father and the God of all.

    Percy Bysshe Shelley, an eminent English poet, while sailing in the

    a squall which wrecked the boat in which he had embarked. Two weeks
    afterwards his body was washed ashore. The Tuscan quarantine
    regulations at that time required that whatever came ashore from the
    sea should be burned. Shelley&#8217;s body was accordingly placed on a

<h1><a id="d-a" name="d-a">John Marchborn Cooley.</a></h1>


<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">John Marchborn Cooley</span>, the eldest son of the late Corbin Cooley, was
born at the Cooley homestead, on the Susquehanna river, in Cecil county,
a short distance below the junction of that stream and the Octoraro
creek, on the first of March, 1827; and died at Darlington, Harford
county, Maryland, April 13th, 1878.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In childhood he showed a taste for learning, and in early youth was sent
to West Nottingham Academy, where he received his education. While at
the Academy he is said to have been always willing to write the
compositions of his fellow students, and to help them with any literary
work in which they were engaged.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Cooley studied law in the office of the late Col. John C. Groome,
and was admitted to the Elkton bar on the 4th of April, 1850. He
practiced his profession in Elkton for a short time, during a part of
which he was counsel to the County Commissioners, but removed to Warsaw,
Illinois, where he continued to practice his profession for six years,
after which he came to Harford county, where he resided until the
outbreaking of the war of the rebellion, when he joined the Union army
and continued to serve his country until the close of the war. In 1866,
he married Miss Hattie Lord, of Manchester, New Hampshire, and settled
in Darlington, Harford county, Maryland, where he was engaged in
teaching a classical school until the time of his death.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Cooley was born within a few miles of the birthplace of William P.
and E.E. Ewing, and Emma Alice Brown and almost within sight of the
mansion in which Mrs. Hall wrote the poems which are published in this
book.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Cooley was a born poet, a voluminous and beautiful writer, and the
author of several poems of considerable length and great merit.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Cooley&#8217;s widow and son, Marvin L. Cooley, still survive, and at
present reside in Darlington.

Each in the spot where it first view&#8217;d<br />
Th&#8217; approaching wand&#8217;rer mutely stood.<br />
Ere silence had oppressive grown<br />
The old man&#8217;s voice thus found a tone;<br />
&#8220;I too was once as blithe and gay&#8212;<br />
My days as lightly flew away<br />
As if I counted all their hours<br />
Upon a dial-plate of flowers;<br />
And gentle slumber oft renew&#8217;d<br />
The joyance of my waking mood,<br />
As if my soul in slumber caught<br />
The radiance of expiring thought;<br />
As if perception&#8217;s farewell beam<br />
Could tinge my bosom with a dream&#8212;<br />
That twilight of the mind which throws<br />
Such mystic splendor o&#8217;er repose.<br />
Contrasted with a youth so bright<br />
My manhood seems one dreary night,<br />
A chilling, cheerless night, like those<br />
Which over Arctic regions close.<br />
I married one, to my fond eyes<br />
An angel draped in human guise.<br />
Alas! she had one failing;<br />
<span class="il1">No secret could she keep</span><br />
In spite of all my railing,<br />
<span class="il1">And curses loud and deep.</span><br />
No matter what the danger<br />
<span class="il1">Of gossiping might be,</span><br />
She&#8217;d gossip with a stranger<br />
<span class="il1">As quickly as with me.</span><br />
One can&#8217;t be always serious,<br />
<span class="il1">And talking just for show,</span><br />
For that is deleterious<br />
<span class="il1">To fellowship, and so</span><br />
I oft with her would chatter,<br />
<span class="il1">Just as I felt inclined,</span><br />
Of any little matter<br />
<span class="il1">I chanced to call to mind.</span><br />
Alas! on one ill-fated day,<br />
I heard an angry neighbor say,<br />
&#8216;Don&#8217;t tell John Jones of your affairs,<br />
<span class="il1">Don&#8217;t tell him for your life,</span><br />
Without you wish the world to know,<br />
<span class="il1">For he will tell his wife.&#8217;</span><br />
&#8216;For he will tell his wife&#8217; did ring<br />
<span class="il1">All day through heart and brain;</span><br />
In sleep a nightmare stole his voice,<br />
<span class="il1">And shouted it again.</span><br />
I spent whole days in meditating<br />
<span class="il1">How I should break the spell,</span><br />
Which made my wife keep prating<br />
<span class="il1">Of things she shouldn&#8217;t tell.</span><br />
Some awful crime I&#8217;ll improvise,<br />
<span class="il1">Which I&#8217;ll to her confide,</span><br />
Upon the instant home I rushed,<br />
<span class="il1">My hands in blood were dyed.</span><br />
&#8216;Now, Catharine, by your love for me,<br />
<span class="il1">My secret closely hide.&#8217;</span><br />
Her quiet tongue, for full three days,<br />
<span class="il1">The secret kept so well,</span><br />
I almost grew to hope that she<br />
<span class="il1">This secret wouldn&#8217;t tell.</span><br />
Alas! upon the following day<br />
<span class="il1">She had revealed it, for I found</span><br />
Some surly men with warrants arm&#8217;d<br />
<span class="il1">Were slyly lurking round.</span><br />
They took me to the county jail<br />
<span class="il1">My tristful Kate pursuing,</span><br />
And all the way she sobb&#8217;d and cried<br />
<span class="il1">&#8216;Oh! what have I been doing?&#8217;</span><br />
Before the judge I was arraigned,<br />
<span class="il1">Who sternly frowning gazed on me,</span><br />
And by his clerk straightway inquired,<br />
<span class="il1">What was the felon&#8217;s plea.</span><br />
May&#8217;t please your honor, I exclaim&#8217;d<br />
<span class="il1">This case you may dismiss&#8212;</span><br />
Now hearken all assembled here,<br />
<span class="il1">My whole defence is this:</span><br />
I killed a dog&#8212;a thievish wretch&#8212;<br />
<span class="il1">His body may be found,</span><br />
Beneath an apple tree of mine,<br />
<span class="il1">A few feet under ground,</span><br />
This simple plot I laid in hope<br />
<span class="il1">To cure my tattling wife;</span><br />
I find, alas! that she must talk,<br />
<span class="il1">Though talking risk my life.</span><br />
So from her presence then I fled,<br />
In spite of all the tears she shed,<br />
And since, a wand&#8217;ring life I&#8217;ve led,<br />
And told the tale where&#8217;er I sped.&#8221;

<h1><a id="e-a" name="e-a">George Washington Cruikshank.</a></h1>


<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">George W. Cruikshank</span> was born in Fredericktown, Cecil county, Md., May
11th, 1838. He received his early education in the common school of
Cecilton, and was afterwards sent to a military academy at Brandywine
Springs, in New Castle county, Delaware, and graduated at Delaware
College in 1858.
</p>

<p class="prose">
He is among the very best classical and literary scholars that his
native county has produced. Mr. Cruikshank studied law for about a year
in the office of Charles J.M. Gwinn, of Baltimore, but was compelled by
the threatened loss of sight to relinquish study until 1865, when he
completed the prescribed course of reading in the office of Colonel John
C. Groome, in Elkton, and was admitted to the Elkton Bar on September
18th, 1865, and on the same day purchased an interest in <i>The Cecil
Democrat</i>, and became its editor, a position he still continues to fill.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1883 Mr. Cruikshank became connected with the Baltimore <i>Day</i>, which
he edited while that journal existed.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Cruikshank, in 1869, married his cousin Sarah Elizabeth Cruikshank.
They are the parents of five children&#8212;three of whom survive.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Cruikshank is one of the most forcible and brilliant editorial
writers in the State, and the author of a number of chaste and erudite
poems written in early manhood, only two or three of which have been
published.

<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">Annie McCarer Darlington</span>, the daughter of Charles Biles and Catharine
Ross Biles, was born July 20th, 1836, at Willow Grove, in Cecil county,
about four miles east of the village of Brick Meeting House, and near
the old Blue Ball Tavern. She is a cousin of Mrs. Ida McCormick, whose
poetry may be found in this book, their mothers being sisters. Miss
Biles was married November 20th, 1860, to Francis James Darlington, of
West Chester, Pa., and spent the next five years of her life on a farm
near Unionville, formerly the property of the sculptor, Marshall Swayne.
The family then removed to their present residence near Westtown
Friends&#8217; Boarding School, where they spend the Summer season. The
Winters are spent with their seven children, in a quiet little home in
the town of Melrose, on the banks of the beautiful Lake Santa Fe, in
Florida. Miss Biles began to write poetry when about eighteen years of
age, and for the ensuing five years was a frequent contributor to <i>The
Cecil Democrat</i>, under the <i>nom de plume</i> of &#8220;Gertrude St. Orme.&#8221;

<h1><a id="g-a" name="g-a">Rev. William Duke.</a></h1>


<p class="prose">
The <span class="bio-subject">Rev. William Duke</span> was born in the southern part of what is now
Harford county, but was at the time of his birth included in Baltimore
county, on the 15th of September, 1757, and died in Elkton on the 31st
of May, 1840. He became enamoured of the doctrines of Methodism in early
youth, and allied himself with that denomination before its separation
from the Protestant Episcopal Church, and was licensed to preach by Rev.
Francis Asbury when he was only seventeen years old. Mr. Duke&#8217;s name
appears upon the minutes of the first Conference, held in Philadelphia
in 1774, as one of the seven ministers who were that year taken on
trial. The next year he was admitted to full membership, and remained in
connection with the Conference as a traveling preacher until 1779, when
he ceased to travel, and subsequently took orders in the Protestant
Episcopal Church; being impelled to do so by his opposition to the
erection of the Methodist Society into an independent Church.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Duke became Rector of North Elk Parish in 1793, but resigned the
charge three years later, and removed to Anne Arundel county, but
returned to Elkton about a year afterwards; soon after he removed to
Kent county, where he taught a parochial school for a short time, but
returned to Elkton again in 1799 and opened a school, and preached
during the three following years at North East, Elkton, and at the
Episcopal Church near New London, Pa.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1803 he was appointed Professor of Languages in St. John&#8217;s College,
Annapolis, and had charge of St. Ann&#8217;s Church, in that city, until 1806,
when he returned to Elkton, and the next year took charge of the Elkton
Academy.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Duke remained in Cecil county until 1812, when he took charge of
Charlotte Hall, in St. Mary&#8217;s county, and continued in charge of the
school at that place until 1814, when he returned to Elkton, where he
officiated as aforetime until the Spring of 1818, when he was appointed
Principal of the Academy. He continued to reside in Elkton until the
time of his death.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1793 Mr. Duke married Hetty Coudon, the daughter of the Rev. Joseph
Coudon, a former Rector of North Elk Parish, and the ancestor of the
Coudon family of this county. Mr. and Mrs. Duke were the parents of Miss
Hetty Duke, who was their only child, and who died in Elkton, February
19th, 1875.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Duke was a very learned man, and is said by the Rev. Ethan Allan,
the Historian of &#8220;The Old Parishes of Maryland,&#8221; to have been more of
the student than the preacher. He was the author of a pamphlet published
in Elkton in 1795, entitled &#8220;Observations on the Present State of
Religion in Maryland,&#8221; which is now of great rarity and value. He also
published a small volume entitled &#8220;Hymns and Poems on Various
Occasions,&#8221; which was printed by Samuel and John Adams, of Baltimore, in
1790; and several other poems of considerable length, the most popular
of which was entitled &#8220;A View of the Woods,&#8221; which was descriptive of
the adventures and experience of Western emigrants in the latter part of
the last century.

<h1><a id="h-a" name="h-a">Edwin Evans Ewing.</a></h1>


<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">Edwin Evans Ewing</span>, son of Patrick Ewing and brother of William Pinkney
Ewing, was born on his father&#8217;s farm on the Octoraro creek, not far from
Rowlandville, in this county, on the 9th of January, 1824. His family is
of Scotch-Irish extraction, and settled on the Octoraro more than a
century ago. The family has long been distinguished for the
intellectuality and literary ability of its members, among whom were the
Rev. John Ewing, one of the most eminent scientists and Presbyterian
divines of his time, and his daughter Sarah, who became the wife of John
Hall, and whose biography is published in this volume.
</p>

<p class="prose">
The subject of this sketch spent his youth and early manhood, on his
father&#8217;s farm. Recently when asked for a sketch of his life Mr. Ewing
replied: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have any life. I just growed like Topsy. I didn&#8217;t
have any educating. I just picked it up; and as for poetry, I never
wrote any, only rhyme.&#8221; Notwithstanding this assertion, Mr. Ewing being
unable to resist the prompting of the &#8220;divinity which stirred within
him,&#8221; when quite young, began to write poetry. There seems to be a
subtle influence pervading the romantic Octoraro hills, which if not the
direct cause of poetic inspiration seems to encourage its growth, Mr.
Ewing being one of five poets who claim that region as their birthplace,
or who have profited by a residence therein.
</p>

<p class="prose">
When quite young Mr. Ewing wrote poetry which was published in the local
journals of Cecil and Lancaster counties, and subsequently contributed
poetry to the Philadelphia <i>Dollar Newspaper</i>, being a contemporary
contributor to that journal with his brother, William P. Ewing, and the
late David Scott (of James.)
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1856 Mr. Ewing made a trip to the Southwest, traveling extensively on
horseback in Texas. He gave an account of his travels and a description
of the country through which he passed in a series of letters published
in the <i>Cecil Whig</i>, which were much admired.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1861, Mr. Ewing became the proprietor and editor of the <i>Cecil Whig</i>,
which was the Union organ of the county. Being a man of decided
convictions, and unflinching courage, he never lost an opportunity to
advocate the cause of the Union, to which he adhered with great
devotion, through evil and through good report.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1876 he disposed of the <i>Whig</i> and the next year bought an interest
in the <i>Kansas Farmer</i> and the <i>Juvenile Magazine</i>, published in Topeka,
Kansas. He subsequently became connected with the <i>Daily Capital</i>, and
eventually became sole proprietor of the <i>Kansas Farmer</i>. The climate of
Kansas not agreeing with him, he removed to Highlands, Macon county,
N.C., where in 1882 he established the <i>Blue Ridge Enterprise</i> which he
soon afterwards disposed of, and in 1885 became the proprietor of the
<i>Midland Journal</i>, published in the village of Rising Sun, in this
county.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Ewing is a brilliant and forcible writer. Like many others Mr. Ewing
kept none of his poems except one which is too lengthy to be given a
place in this volume. In consequence of this the compiler has only been
able to obtain the following specimens of his poetry after great labor
and trouble.

Her shining locks of silky hair<br />
<span class="il1">Hung round her neck like grapes of gold,</span><br />
<span class="il1">And o&#8217;er her snowy bosom roll&#8217;d,</span><br />

<p class="stanza">
The brightest of the fairy throng,<br />
She led the dancing group along<br />

<span class="il1">But she who moved with elfin pace,</span><br />
And taught the infant throng to play,<br />
<span class="il1">Raised to heaven her cherub face,</span><br />
While that bright celestial ray,<br />
<span class="il1">Which halos the throne of glory round,</span><br />
Illumed her azure, orient eye,<br />
That seemed to penetrate the sky.<br />
<span class="il1">Bending her gaze upon the ground,</span><br />
Her gentle bosom heaved a sigh,<br />
<span class="il1">And anxious faces press around,</span><br />
While pearls of pity dim each eye,<br />
As tho&#8217; they&#8217;d weep again to rest<br />
The troubled spirit of that breast.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
&#8220;Weep not for me!&#8221; the cherub said,<br />
While o&#8217;er her seraph beauty played<br />
A smile like evening&#8217;s parting beam,<br />
That sparkles o&#8217;er the glassy stream,<br />
Or lingers on a lucid lake&#8212;<br />
Whose dimpling wave the zephyrs break.<br />
&#8220;Far thro&#8217; yon skies, where orient day<br />
Is shedding his last lingering ray,<br />
Bright angels beckon me away;&#8212;<br />
I go&#8212;I go&#8212;a last farewell!&#8221;<br />
And as she spoke around her fell,<br />

And &#8217;mid that heavenly blaze unfold<br />
Her glittering pinions tipp&#8217;d with gold.<br />
While strains of sweet unearthly sound<br />
Awoke their dulcet chime around,<br />
She soared away on wings of light,<br />
Like sparkling meteor of the night;<br />
Still lessening, as she further drew<br />
Amid the ether of heavenly blue,<br />
<span class="il1">Till lost within a blazing star</span><br />
That above the horizon shown&#8212;<br />
<span class="il1">As if from Paradise a car</span><br />
&#8217;Twere sent to bear the cherub home.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
No more that happy throng is rending,<br />
<span class="il1">With gladsome shouts the summer air,</span><br />
Nor songs of love to heaven ascending,<br />
<span class="il1">From hearts that know no guile nor care;</span><br />
But on each peerless infant brow<br />
The gloom of care is settling now;<br />
While passion madly fires each eye,<br />
And swells each bosom beating high;<br />
And tongues that lisped an infant name,<br />
Now speak in haughty tones of Fame!<br />
While some, in senatorial pride,<br />
With scorn their fellow-man deride;<br />
<span class="il1">And others, more sanguinary still,</span><br />
From words of ire appeal to brands,<br />
<span class="il1">Nor scruple a brother&#8217;s blood to spill&#8212;</span><br />
Cain-like!&#8212;with ensanguined hands<br />
Polluting the flowers which smile&#8212;in vain<br />
Wooing the heart to love again.

Long o&#8217;er this painful scene I sighed,<br />

&#8220;And was this bright&#8212;this fair domain&#8212;<br />
With all its beauty, formed in vain?<br />
Where Nature, a paradise to grace,<br />
Hath loved her every charm to trace,<br />
That man, enamored of distress<br />
Should mar it into wilderness?&#8221;<br />

<h1><a id="i-a" name="i-a">William Pinkney Ewing.</a></h1>


<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">William Pinkney Ewing</span>, son of Patrick Ewing, was born May 28, 1828, on
his father&#8217;s farm near Rowlandville. He is a brother of Edwin E. Ewing,
a sketch of whose life is published in this book, and to which the
reader is referred for other information respecting the family. Mr.
Ewing&#8217;s early life was spent on his father&#8217;s farm. When about eighteen
years of age he commenced to write poetry, the first of which was
published in the Philadelphia <i>Dollar Newspaper</i>. He was subsequently a
frequent contributor to the <i>Ladies&#8217; Garland</i>, the <i>Cecil Whig</i> and
<i>Cecil Democrat</i>. In 1848, Mr. Ewing commenced the study of the law in
the office of the late John C. Groome in Elkton, and was admitted to the
Elkton Bar, April 10, 1851. In 1853 he removed to Cincinnati, and became
connected with the editorial department of the <i>Daily Atlas</i> of that
city, and contributed editorially and otherwise to several other papers
in Cincinnati, until the <i>Atlas</i> was merged into the <i>Gazette</i>. He then
accepted a position on the <i>Southern Lady&#8217;s Book</i>, published in New
Orleans and remained in that city until the magazine changed
proprietors. Mr. Ewing returned to Elkton in 1855, and resumed the
practice of his profession, but continued to write poetry occasionally
for some years afterwards. In 1871 Mr. Ewing removed to Ashtabula, Ohio,
and has since been connected with newspapers in Chicago, Topeka and
other western cities; and has corresponded occasionally with the New
York <i>Tribune</i>, New York <i>Evening Post</i> and <i>Chicago Tribune</i>.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In politics Mr. Ewing was originally a Democrat, but in 1850 became a
member of the Free Soil party, and an elector on the Free Soil ticket in
1856. He was a delegate to the Chicago convention that nominated Lincoln
in 1860, and also an elector for the State of Maryland on the Lincoln
ticket the same year. In 186l Mr. Ewing was appointed United States
Naval Agent for the port of Baltimore, and held the position until the
office was abolished in 1865.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In September 1863 he married Mrs. Emma P. Smith, a lady of fine literary
taste and ability who is at this time the head of the cooking school of
the State Agricultural College of Iowa.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Like many other writers Mr. Ewing took no pains to preserve his poems
and it was only after the expenditure of great labor and much trouble
that the following meagre selection was made, which it is feared will
not do full justice to the ability of their author.

<h1><a id="k-a" name="k-a">Mrs. Sarah Hall.</a></h1>


<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">Mrs. Sarah Hall</span> was born in Philadelphia October 30th, 1761, and died in
that city April 8th, 1830. She was the daughter of the Rev. John Ewing,
D.D., a member of the Ewing family of the Eighth district of this
county, and one of the most distinguished scholars and divines of his
time, and who was for many years Provost of the University of
Pennsylvania and pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of
Philadelphia.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Miss Ewing&#8217;s early education was confined to learning to read and write,
and in acquiring a thorough knowledge of housewifery. In 1782 she
married John Hall, a member of the Hall family of the Eighth district,
and the newly wedded pair came to reside in the house near Rowlandville,
formerly owned by the late Commodore Conner, and now occupied by his son
P.S.P. Conner.
</p>

<p class="prose">
It was while residing in this old mansion, surrounded by the picturesque
scenery of the Octoraro hills, that she wrote the poem entitled &#8220;Sketch
of a Landscape,&#8221; which no doubt was inspired by the beauty of the
surrounding scenery and the fine view of the &#8220;Modest Octoraro,&#8221; which
may be had from the porch of the old historic mansion in which she
resided.
</p>

<p class="prose">
After a residence of about eight years in Cecil county the family
removed to Philadelphia, where Mr. Hall successively filled the offices
of Secretary of the Land Office, and United States Marshal for the
District of Pennsylvania. The family returned to Maryland in 1805, and
resided on Mr. Hall&#8217;s paternal estate for about six years.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mrs. Hall&#8217;s literary career commenced with the publication of her
writings in the <i>Port Folio</i>, a literary magazine published in
Philadelphia about the beginning of this century, and of which her son,
John E. Hall, subsequently became the editor. She soon attained high
rank as a magazine writer, and, until the time of her death, occupied a
position second to none of the female writers of this country.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mrs. Hall is best known in the literary world by her book entitled
&#8220;Conversations on the Bible.&#8221; It was written after she was fifty years
of age and the mother of eleven children, and was so popular as to
astonish its author by the rapidity of its sale.

<p class="stanza">
What joyous notes are those, so soft, so sweet,<br />
That unexpected, strike my charmed ear!<br />
They are the Robin&#8217;s song! This genial morn<br />
Deceives the feathered tribe: for yet the sun<br />
In Pisces holds his course; nor yet has Spring<br />
Advanc&#8217;d one legal claim; but though oblique<br />
So mild, so warm, descend his cheering rays,<br />
Impris&#8217;ning winter seems subdued. No dread<br />
Of change retards their wing; but off they soar<br />
Triumphing in the fancied dawn of Spring.<br />
<span class="il1">Advent&#8217;rous birds, and rash! ye little think,</span><br />
Though lilacs bud, and early willows burst.<br />
How soon the blasts of March&#8212;the snowy sleets,<br />
May turn your hasty flight, to seek again<br />
Your wonted warm abodes. Thus prone is youth,<br />
Thus easily allured, to put his trust<br />
In fair appearance; and with hope elate,<br />
And naught suspecting, thus he sallies forth,<br />
To earn experience in the storms of life!<br />
<span class="il1">But why thus chide&#8212;why not with gratitude</span><br />
Receive and cherish ev&#8217;ry gleam of joy?<br />
For many an hour can witness, that not oft,<br />
My solitude is cheered by feelings such,<br />
So blithe&#8212;so pleasurable as thy song<br />
Sweet Robin, gives. Yet on thy graceful banks,<br />
Majestic Susquehanna&#8212;joy might dwell!<br />
For whether bounteous Summer sport her stores,<br />
Or niggard Winter bind them&#8212;still the forms<br />
Most grand, most elegant, that Nature wears<br />
Beneath Columbia&#8217;s skies, are here combin&#8217;d.<br />
<span class="il1">The wide extended landscape glows with more</span><br />
Than common beauty. Hills rise on hills&#8212;<br />
An amphitheater, whose lofty top,<br />
The spreading oak, or stately poplar crowns&#8212;<br />
Whose ever-varying sides present such scenes<br />
Smooth or precipitous&#8212;harmonious still&#8212;<br />
Mild or sublime,&#8212;as wake the poet&#8217;s lay;<br />
Nor aught is wanting to delight the sense;<br />
The gifts of Ceres, or Diana&#8217;s shades.<br />
The eye enraptur&#8217;d roves o&#8217;er woods and dells,<br />
Or dwells complacent on the numerous signs<br />
Of cultivated life. The laborer&#8217;s decent cot,<br />
Marks the clear spring, or bubbling rill.<br />
The lowlier hut hard by the river&#8217;s edge,<br />
The boat, the seine suspended, tell the place<br />
Where in his season hardy fishers toil.<br />
More elevated on the grassy slope,<br />
The farmer&#8217;s mansion rises mid his trees;<br />
Thence, o&#8217;er his fields the master&#8217;s watchful eye<br />
Surveys the whole. He sees his flocks, his herds<br />
Excluded from the grain-built cone; all else,<br />
While rigid winter reigns, their free domain!<br />
Range through the pastures, crop the tender root,<br />
Or climbing heights abrupt, search careful out,<br />
The welcome herb,&#8212;now prematurely sprung<br />
Through half-thawed earth. Beside him spreading elms,<br />
His friendly barrier from th&#8217; invading north,<br />
Contrast their shields defensive with the willow<br />
Whose flexile drapery sweeps his rustic lawn.<br />
Before him lie his vegetable stores,<br />
His garden, orchards, meadows&#8212;all his hopes&#8212;<br />
Now bound in icy chains: but ripening suns<br />
Shall bring their treasures to his plenteous board.<br />
Soon too, the hum of busy man shall wake<br />
Th&#8217; adjacent shores. The baited hook, the net,<br />
Drawn skilful round the wat&#8217;ry cove, shall bring<br />
Their prize delicious to the rural feast.<br />
<span class="il1">Here blooms the laurel on the rugged breaks,</span><br />
Umbrageous, verdant, through the circling year<br />
His bushy mantle scorning winds or snows&#8212;<br />
While there&#8212;two ample streams confluent grace&#8212;<br />
Complete the picture&#8212;animate the whole!<br />
Broad o&#8217;er the plain the Susquehanna rolls,<br />
His rapid waves far sounding as he comes.<br />
Through many a distant clime and verdant vale,<br />
A thousand springy caverns yield their rills,<br />
Augmenting still his force. The torrent grows,<br />
Spreads deep and wide, till braving all restraint<br />
Ev&#8217;n mountain ridges feel the imperious press;<br />
Forced from their ancient rock-bound base&#8212;they leave<br />
Their monumental sides, erect, to guard<br />
The pass&#8212;and tell to future days, and years,<br />
The wond&#8217;rous tale! Meanwhile,<br />
The conqueror flood holds on his course,<br />
Resistless ever&#8212;sinuous, or direct.<br />
Unconscious tribes beneath his surface play,<br />
Nor heed the laden barques, his surface bear;<br />
Now gliding swiftly by the threat&#8217;ning rocks,<br />
Now swimming smoothly to the distant bay.<br />
To meet and bring his liberal tribute too,<br />
The modest Octoraro winds his way&#8212;<br />
Not ostentatious like a boasting world<br />
Their little charities proclaiming loud&#8212;<br />
But silent through the glade retir&#8217;d and wild,<br />
Between the shaded banks on either hand,<br />
Till circling yonder meed&#8212;he yields his name.<br />
Nor proudly, Susquehanna! boast thy gain,<br />
For thence, not far, thou too, like him shall give<br />
Thy congregated waters, title&#8212;all,<br />
To swell the nobler name of Chesapeake!<br />
<span class="il1">And is not such a scene as this the spell,</span><br />
That lulls the restless passions into peace?<br />
Yes. Cold must be the sordid heart, unmov&#8217;d<br />
By Nature&#8217;s bounties: but they cannot fill,<br />
That ardent craving in the mind of man,<br />
For social intercourse,&#8212;the healthful play&#8212;<br />
The moral gem&#8212;the light of intellect&#8212;<br />
Communion sweet with those we love!

The bud expands, the flower blooms,<br />

<h1><a id="l-a" name="l-a">Mrs. Sallie Williams Hardcastle.</a></h1>


<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">Mrs. Hardcastle&#8217;s</span> maiden name was Sallie Williams Minter. She was born
in Bedford county, Virginia, June 19, 1841.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Reared in the shadow of the Peaks of Otter, whose lofty summits tower in
magnificent grandeur far above the wooded heights and billowy green
hills of the surrounding country, it is little wonder that the subject
of this sketch should have been early imbued with the spirit of poesy,
and led to the cultivation of tastes and the selection of themes which
the grand and picturesque in nature are apt to suggest. But in addition
to these favorable surroundings, a literary and thoughtful turn of mind
was inherited from her father and grandfather&#8212;the latter having been
eminent in his day as the author of a religious work, replete with keen
arguments and logical conclusions.
</p>

<p class="prose">
The former also was a writer of ability, and having a thorough knowledge
of the politics of his State, frequently discussed them in the local
journals with a ready and trenchant pen.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mrs. Hardcastle was educated at Bedford Female College, but is indebted
to her father for her best and earliest tuition. At the age of fourteen
her first verses, written on the death of a little friend of her own
age, were published in the <i>Virginia Sentinel</i>. She was an occasional
contributor to the <i>Literacy Companion</i>, <i>Magnolia Weekly</i>, and other
Southern periodicals.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mrs. Hardcastle was married in 1863 to Dr. Jerome H. Hardcastle, then a
surgeon in the hospital at Liberty, Va. After the war they came to
Maryland, and subsequently, in 1876, to Cecilton, in this county, where
they have since resided. They are the parents of five daughters and one
son.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Like many other persons, Mrs. Hardcastle neglected to carefully preserve
her poetical writings. And was so unfortunate as to lose most of the few
in her possession at the time of the evacuation of Richmond, in
consequence of which the following poems are all it has been practicable
to obtain, which is a matter of regret, inasmuch as they are by no means
the best of her writings.

<h1><a id="m-a" name="m-a">Mrs. Mary Eliza Ireland.</a></h1>


<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">Mrs. Mary Eliza Ireland</span>, the daughter of Joseph Haines and Harriet
(Kirk) Haines, was born in the village of Brick Meeting House, now
called Calvert, January 9, 1834. In early life she married John M.
Ireland, son of Colonel Joseph Ireland, of Kent county, Md. They are the
parents of three children, one of whom died in infancy. They now reside
in Baltimore, where Mr. Ireland holds the position of United States
storekeeper in the Internal Revenue Department.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Until the past few years Mrs. Ireland has always lived in the old
homestead where she was born and married, and from whence her parents
were removed by death.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Her first literary effort was a short story written when quite a young
girl, entitled &#8220;Ellen Linwood,&#8221; and published in the <i>Cecil Whig</i>, then
edited by the late Palmer C. Ricketts, under the <i>nom de plume</i> of
&#8220;Marie Norman.&#8221; For several years after the publication of &#8220;Ellen
Linwood&#8221; Mrs. Ireland occasionally contributed to the <i>Cecil Whig</i> and
Oxford <i>Press</i>.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Some years ago she wrote a story for <i>Arthur&#8217;s Magazine</i>, and being in
Philadelphia soon after it was written, she took it to the publishing
house, and there met for the first time T.S. Arthur, whom she had known
from childhood through his books. He received her kindly, promised to
read her story, and to let her know his decision the next day. That
decision was, that though entertaining and well written, it was scarcely
suited to his magazine. He suggested another periodical where it would
likely meet with favor. He also asked for another story, and presented
her with a set of the magazines that she might see the style of writing
that he desired.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Her next story for <i>Arthur&#8217;s</i> was a success, and from that time until
his death he remained the candid critic of all she sent him for
publication, as well as of some stories published elsewhere, and the
kind literary adviser and friend. She retained her first story (which he
had declined) for three years, made some changes in it, and he accepted
and published it.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Since then she has been an acceptable contributor to <i>Cottage Hearth</i>,
<i>Household</i>, and other domestic magazines, besides the <i>Literary World</i>,
<i>Ladies&#8217; Cabinet</i>, <i>Woman&#8217;s Journal</i>, and several church papers; and has
written two prize stories, which took first prizes.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1882 her short stories were collected and connected into a continued
story, which was accepted and published by J.B. Lippincott &#38; Co., under
the title of &#8220;Timothy; His Neighbors and His Friends.&#8221;
</p>

<p class="prose">
Many letters of appreciation from distant parts of the Union testified
to the merit of the book, and she was encouraged to accede to the
request of the Presbyterian Observer Company of Baltimore to write a
serial for their paper. It was entitled &#8220;Ivandale,&#8221; and was warmly
commended by judges of literary work.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Wishing to read German literature in the original, she undertook the
study of German, and as she had no time which she was willing to devote
to regular lessons, she obtained a German pronouncing reader, and
without instruction from any one she succeeded in learning to read and
translate, pronouncing correctly enough to be understood by any German.
This knowledge of the language has been a well-spring of pleasure to
her, and well repays her for the few moments&#8217; attention she daily
bestowed upon it. She has translated several books, two of which were
published as serials in the <i>Oxford Press</i>, and the Lutheran Board of
Publication have published one of her translations, entitled &#8220;Betty&#8217;s
Decision.&#8221; Many beautiful short stories have found their way into our
language and periodicals through the medium of her pen.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Her time is well filled with her household duties, her missionary and
church work, and in reviewing new books for the press. She has no
specified time for writing, nor does she neglect her household or social
duties for the sake of it, always having looked upon her literary work
as a recreation. She leads a busy life, yet is rarely hurried; and,
although she enjoys the companionship of many people noted in
literature, it is powerless to weaken her attachment for friends who
have no inclination in that way. All have a warm place in her heart, and
a cordial welcome to her cheerful and happy home.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mrs. Ireland, contrary to the experience of most writers, never wrote
any poetry until she had attained distinction as a writer of prose.

This gave me a hint; I veered from my track,<br />

I carried her fan, and indulged in a sigh,<br />

A bachelor gray, was Valentine Brown;<br />
He lived in a mansion just out of the town,<br />
<span class="il2">A mansion spacious and grand;</span><br />
He was wealthy as Vanderbilt, Astor or Tome,<br />
Had money invested abroad and at home,<br />
<span class="il2">And thousands of acres of land.</span>

<p class="stanza">
A friend of his boyhood was Archibald Gray;<br />
And to prove what queer antics Dame Fortune will play<br />

And always left Archibald out of her fold,<br />
<span class="il2">The harmless, and weak-minded man.</span>

<p class="stanza">
So, while Valentine reigned like a king on his throne,<br />
Poor Archibald ne&#8217;er had a home of his own,<br />
<span class="il2">Yet never was known to complain;</span><br />

In mansion and farmhouse a welcome he found<br />
<span class="il2">As long as he chose to remain.</span>

<p class="stanza">
The lilacs and snowballs which guarded the door<br />

<span class="il2">When Archibald&#8217;s travel-worn feet</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
Were heard on the door-step; he entered and smiled,<br />
Then sat down and slept like a play-weary child,<br />
<span class="il2">Woke, and told them how long he would stay;</span><br />
Then slumbered again, while sweet Dorothy Moore,<br />
The motherless daughter, who loved all God&#8217;s poor,<br />
<span class="il2">Made him welcome around the tea-tray.</span>

<p class="stanza">

<p class="stanza">
But, drawing the curtains on darkness and night!<br />
She sat down to spin by the cheery fire-light,<br />

And her wheel, with its humming activity, lent<br />
<span class="il2">To the hour, a picturesque charm.</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
No scene more enchanting could artist dream know,<br />
Than this peaceful, calm spot, in the ruby-red glow<br />
<span class="il2">Of the pine knots aflame on the hearth;</span><br />
But Dorothy thought, &#8220;Were he but there with me<br />
And loved me as I love, a desert would be<br />
<span class="il2">The happiest place upon earth.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
&#8220;Oh were he but poor, and forsaken;&#8221; she sighed,<br />

Since all is so hopeless, dear Father above<br />
Oh help me to cast out my unreturned love!<br />
<span class="il2">And forget the proud Valentine Brown.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
In his elegant library, sat Valentine Brown,<br />
The argand burned brightly, the rich curtains down,<br />
<span class="il2">Luxurious home of repose;&#8212;</span><br />
Yet his handsome face saddened, his heart was oppressed;<br />
He sighed, and his spirit was full of unrest,<br />
<span class="il2">For his love he should never disclose.</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
He had roamed over Europe, and Countesses fair<br />
Had graciously smiled on the great millionaire.<br />
<span class="il2">Yet his heart had turned coldly away;</span><br />
&#8220;From her childhood, I&#8217;ve loved her, sweet Dorothy Moore,&#8221;<br />
Just then the latch clicked&#8212;through the half opened door<br />
<span class="il2">Crept humbly, poor Archibald Gray.</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
&#8220;I want you!&#8221; he whispered; &#8220;I promised her, come!&#8221;<br />
And Valentine followed, till reaching the home<br />
<span class="il2">Where Dorothy spun by the hearth;</span><br />
And when he had entered with Archibald Gray<br />
And courteously waited, commands to obey,<br />
<span class="il2">Knew no lovelier picture on earth.</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
But the tact which had piloted Valentine there<br />
Deserted poor Archie; then Dorothy fair,<br />
<span class="il2">Blushing deeply, yet smilingly said:</span><br />
&#8220;Why, Archibald, why did you leave us I pray?<br />
You said till to-morrow at noon, you would stay,<br />
<span class="il2">And in less than an hour you had fled.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
The memory of Archibald took up the clew<br />
Thus kindly supplied, and eager he grew;<br />
<span class="il2">&#8220;Yes, yes; Archie promised he would;</span><br />

(Here he smoothed his gray beard, and looked helplessly down),<br />
<span class="il2">&#8220;He&#8217;s so good to poor Archie, so good!&#8221;</span>

<p class="stanza">
The three stood in silence, two wondering no doubt<br />
How this intricate problem would ever turn out,<br />
<span class="il2">And Valentine, thoughtful and kind,&#8212;</span><br />
Felt pity for Archie, who meant for the best;<br />
And for Dorothy&#8212;flushing like clouds in the west<br />
<span class="il2">And fearing he thought it designed.</span>

<p class="stanza">
He looked at the maiden&#8212;modest and sweet;<br />
At her lovely blue eyes, her peach-blossom cheek<br />

<h1><a id="n-a" name="n-a">George Johnston.</a></h1>


<p class="prose" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
[The editor is indebted to his friend, George A. Blake, Esq., of the
Elkton Bar, for the following sketch of his life.]
</p>

<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">George Johnston</span>, the editor and compiler of this book, was born in
Philadelphia, May 15, 1829, the place of his birth being on Penn street,
one door south of the southeast corner of Penn and Lombard streets. He
is the oldest son of Isaac Johnston, and was named for his grandfather,
George Johnston, the youngest son of Isaac Johnson, who lived on his
farm, one mile west of the east end of Mason and Dixon&#8217;s line, as early
as 1755. There is reason to believe that the earliest member of the
family who lived in that neighborhood was Samuel Johnston, who resided
there as early as 1708.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Johnston&#8217;s mother, Susan Curry, was a cousin of his father, she
being the daughter of Ann Spear, the grandmother of Emma Alice Browne, a
sketch of whose life appears in this Volume.
</p>

<p class="prose">
When about two years of age, the subject of this sketch was placed in
charge of his paternal grandmother and his uncle, George Johnston, who
resided on the homestead, in Cecil county. Here he was carefully
nurtured and trained, and here were planted the seeds which have since
sprung up and brought forth fruit in his intellectual and moral life.
The family being Presbyterian in training, and of the type from which
sprang those who in earlier years drafted the Mecklenberg Declaration,
the lad was early imbued with those religious principles which ever
serve as the true basis of mental growth and moral purpose.
</p>

<p class="prose">
The educational advantages of a half century ago were not such as are
enjoyed by the youth of to-day; but such as the neighborhood provided
and his uncle&#8217;s means afforded, were placed at the disposal of the boy,
who soon manifested an aptitude to learn. When but five years of age he
was sent to what was then called a &#8220;Subscription School,&#8221; kept in the
neighborhood. This he attended during the next seven years, and in the
Winter time until the year 1849, when he took charge as teacher of a
school, in the Center School House, situated near Fair Hill, in Cecil
county.

<p class="prose">
In the Spring of 1847 Mr. Johnston spent three months in Chesapeake City
(in this county) as an apprentice to the carpenter business. He
completed his trade in the neighborhood in which he had been raised, and
from the year 1851 to 1864 spent his time about equally in teaching
school and working at his trade.
</p>

<p class="prose">
When the war of the rebellion broke out in 1861, Mr. Johnston, without
hesitation, took the side of the Union, and was, during all those dark
days, an ardent supporter of the Government, the intensity of his
convictions being no doubt increased by the result of his observations
during a business trip to Texas and through the South in the Winter of
eighteen hundred and sixty and sixty-one.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In the Constitutional Convention of this State in 1864 he served with
ability as committee clerk, having accepted the position at the
solicitation of the late David Scott (of John), who was a member of that
body. While acting as committee clerk, Mr. Johnston had the honor of
engrossing that section of the Constitution which abolished slavery in
the State of Maryland. Many years afterwards he presented the pen used
on that occasion to Frederick Douglass, then United States Marshal of
the District of Columbia.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Johnston&#8217;s health, which had always been precarious, became so bad
in 1875 that he was obliged to abandon his trade and turn his attention
to another occupation. Accordingly, two years later he became connected
with <i>The Cecil Whig</i>, and for about three years had charge of its local
columns. While associated with that journal, his attention was attracted
to the mine of wealth offered to the investigator by the early history
of Cecil county. Prompted by a love of historical investigation, he was
led to make researches into this mine&#8212;a task hitherto largely
unattempted or ineffectually prosecuted. The results of these studies
enriched the columns of <i>The Cecil Whig</i> during a period of three years,
and attracted wide attention. In 1881 he published the &#8220;History of Cecil
County, Md., and the Early Settlements Around the Head of the Chesapeake
Bay and on the Delaware River, with Sketches of Some of the Old Families
of Cecil County.&#8221; This work, which embodied the results of the author&#8217;s
investigations during a period of some years, is one of rare value. To
those who have given but little thought to the subject, it is ever a
matter of surprise to learn how closely the history of Cecil and the
surrounding counties is interwoven with that of our common country, and
how valuable as data of the past are the materials which invited the
lover of truth to their discovery. One can scarcely estimate the
laborious research involved in the task of gathering the component parts
of a history which stretched over a period of nearly two hundred and
seventy-five years. Old volumes, musty records, masses of court
documents, correspondence (official and otherwise), previous historical
attempts, personal knowledge, tradition and personal interviews, were
all laid under contribution by the author, and served as sources of his
authority. These he has woven together with such judgment in selection,
skill in arrangement and force of style and diction, that just as
&#8220;Gray&#8217;s Elegy&#8221; alone has placed him in the front rank of poets, so this
one work has given the author a high and permanent place among the
historians of our country. The work attempted is so well done, and
withal so accurate and reliable as one of reference and authority, that
in recognition of its merits Mr. Johnston has been elected a member of
the Historical Societies of Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and
Wisconsin.
</p>

<p class="prose">
On January 1, 1883, he became local editor of <i>The Cecil Democrat</i>, and
was in such capacity connected with that newspaper for three years and a
half.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Early in life Mr. Johnston was a pupil of David Scott (of James), who
then taught a school in the Fourth district of Cecil county, and whose
sister, Miss Hannah F. Scott, he subsequently married. The scholar being
advanced in studies beyond the other pupils of the school, naturally a
close intimacy was formed between him and his teacher. This afterwards
deepened into a friendship which continued without interruption until
Mr. Scott&#8217;s death, and was the means of creating in Mr. Johnston an
ardent love of poetry. Since 1851 he has written a number of poems, some
of which have appeared in print. These have been so well received by the
public that the author, in deference to the wishes of some of his
friends, has ventured to include the following rhymes in this work:

I never drank the wine of bliss,<br />

<h1><a id="o-a" name="o-a">William James Jones.</a></h1>


<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">William James Jones</span> was born in Elkton, August 25, 1829, and received
his education at the common school and Academy in that town. His youth
and early manhood was spent in mechanical pursuits and in the
improvement of his mind by a desultory course of reading, and in
perfecting himself in the knowledge of the Latin language.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1852, Mr. Jones purchased a half interest in the <i>Cecil Whig</i> and
became the editor of that journal for a short time, and until its
founder P.C. Ricketts, who was then editing the <i>Daily News</i>, of
Baltimore, returned from that city and resumed the duties of editor of
the <i>Whig</i>.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1853, Mr. Jones commenced the study of the law in the office of John
C. Groome, Esq., in Elkton and was admitted to the Bar, September 21,
1855.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In politics Mr. Jones was a Whig, but allied himself with the American
party when it was in course of formation and continued to be an active
member as long as the party lasted. In 1857 he was appointed State&#8217;s
Attorney for Cecil county, to fill a vacancy, and in 1859 was elected to
the same office for the term of four years. At the outbreak of the war
of the rebellion Mr. Jones allied himself with the Union cause and was
elected to the House of Delegates by the Union party in 1863, and was
appointed two years afterwards, United States&#8217; District Attorney for the
district of Maryland, and held the office for about a year, and until he
was removed by President Andrew Johnson for opposing his policy of
reconstruction. In 1858 he married Miss Mary Jane Smith, of Connecticut.
They are the parents of one son and two daughters, the eldest of whom is
the wife of Rev. Walter E. Avery, of the Wilmington Conference.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Jones is one of the most earnest and successful members of the
Elkton Bar, and though not a voluminous writer, in early life
contributed poetry to the columns of the <i>Cecil Whig</i>, of which the
following poems are specimens.

<h1><a id="p-a" name="p-a">John Henry Kimble.</a></h1>


<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">John Henry Kimble</span> was born in Buckingham township, Bucks county,
Pennsylvania, September 8, 1850. He is the second son of Henry H.
Kimble, and is descended on his father&#8217;s side from English stock, being
a lineal descendant from Governor John Carver, who came to this country
in the Mayflower in 1620. On his mother&#8217;s side, his grandfather, Seruch
Titus, was a prominent citizen of Bucks county, and, as his name
indicates, was of Italian descent.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Kimble moved with his parents to the Fourth Election district of
Cecil county, in the Spring of 1855, and has been engaged in farming all
his life, except two years spent in teaching in our public schools. He
is a popular music teacher and performer on musical instruments, and has
won local distinction as a debater.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1870 his first verses were published in the <i>Morris Scholastic</i> a
newspaper published in Grundy county, Illinois. He afterwards wrote for
the <i>Cecil Whig</i>. In 1875 he wrote &#8220;The Patrons of Husbandry,&#8221; a serial
poem, which was published by the Grange organ of the State of
Pennsylvania, in seven parts, with illustrations. It was pronounced by
competent critics to be one of the &#8220;best and most natural descriptions
of farm life ever written.&#8221; It attracted wide attention and received
favorable comment from the N.Y. <i>World</i> and other leading papers. He
wrote another serial in 1876, entitled &#8220;Two Granges.&#8221;
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Kimble makes no pretensions as a writer and has never allowed his
love of literature to interfere with his farm work. In the Winters of
1872, &#8217;73 and &#8217;74 he taught in the public schools of this county with
satisfaction to his patrons.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In December, 1873, he was married to Miss Sarah Teresa Gallagher,
daughter of John E. Gallagher, of the Fourth district. They have five
children, three daughters and two sons. In 1880, Mr. Kimble moved from
the farm near Fair Hill, where he had spent twenty-five years, to
Appleton, where he still resides. He is now a frequent and popular
contributor to the <i>Cecil Democrat</i>.

<p class="stanza">
The shade of death had haunted him<br />
<span class="il1">Through many a weary day;</span><br />
With dread disease his youthful frame<br />
<span class="il1">Was wasting slow away.</span><br />
He took his violin and sighed,&#8212;<br />
<span class="il1">&#8220;I am too weak to play.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
But, rising in his cushioned chair,<br />

</p>

<p class="stanza">
Now fast, now slow, he draws the bow<br />

A march, a waltz, a polka, and<br />
<span class="il1">An intricate quadrille,</span><br />
Each in its turn is rendered with<br />
<span class="il1">An artist&#8217;s ready skill.</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
With failing strength he strikes at length<br />
<span class="il1">His favorite&#8212;&#8220;Home, Sweet Home;&#8221;</span><br />

<span class="il1">The pleasing past to roam,</span><br />
And, through the future, seems to rise<br />
<span class="il1">Up, up to Heaven&#8217;s high dome.</span>
</p>

<p class="stanza">
And mingling with his violin<br />
<span class="il1">He hears the joyful strains</span><br />
That vibrate o&#8217;er angelic hosts,<br />

Oh! glimpse of glory! lifting him<br />
<span class="il1">Above all mortal pains.</span>
</p>

The last sweet note of that sweet tune<br />
<span class="il1">Within the room has died&#8212;</span><br />

You look with joy to-day along life&#8217;s vista clear,<br />

And smiling friends will come to crown with glad acclaim<br />
A hero, when you reach the glittering heights of fame.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
Your life will be above the common herd, I trow,<br />
You will not toil and drudge as they are doing now:<br />
Success attend your steps; a word I would not say<br />
To chill your warmest hopes, or shade your sunny way.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
Your mark is high, my child, then aim your arrow straight,<br />
The world has need to-day, of heroes good and great,<br />
You feel so strong; and wish life&#8217;s battle would begin,<br />
You&#8217;ll find a chance ere long, to do your best and win.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
But may be you will fail, &#8217;tis ten to one you will,<br />
And men will laugh, to see your lack of pluck and skill,<br />
Perhaps you will not have one mighty thing to do;<br />
But many little things will prove if you are true.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
To carry brick and stone for someone else&#8217;s wall,<br />
To do the hardest part and get no praise at all,<br />
To see a weaker man upheld by circumstance,<br />
And find the path hedged high, just when you would advance;
</p>

<p class="stanza">
Or, in the jostling crowd, to slip, and fall, and see,<br />
How many men will scoff at your adversity,<br />
And though your heart may ache, you must not shed a tear,<br />
But plan, and push, and work, and smother all your fear.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
No darling mother then can sympathize with you,&#8212;<br />
No father when you stick, will kindly pull you through;<br />
Through years of grasping toil the wealth you gain, and fame,<br />
May vanish all, and leave you poverty and shame.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
But you need not be lost, all people are not bad,<br />
The Lord has servants good, as He has ever had;<br />
They&#8217;ll find you in your grief, and lend a helping hand,<br />
And point the road that leads up to the &#8220;Better Land.&#8221;
</p>

<p class="stanza">
Remember this, my child, wherever you may go,<br />
That God rules over all, though it may not seem so;<br />

If not in time, O, surely in eternity.

A dear old friend of mine is very ill, I hear,<br />
I have not seen his face for many a weary year.<br />
Ah, many toilsome days we&#8217;ve spent with little train,<br />

I knew his fears and hopes, he knew my hopes and fears.<br />

He had his faults, and I oft sinned in word and deed;<br />
But through our troubles all, we seldom disagreed.

<p class="stanza">
And when we did, we soon were truly reconciled;<br />
So, while we might have quarrelled, we compromised and smiled.<br />
But fortune bade us part; we bid good-bye at last,<br />
Each toiled as bravely on as both had in the past.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
I&#8217;ve written him, and he has answered prompt and true;<br />
But we have never met as we had promised to.<br />

<p class="stanza">
But when a mutual friend told me this afternoon<br />
That he was very sick and wished to see me soon,<br />

</p>

<p class="stanza">
He looks for me! and I, to reach him scarce can wait,<br />
O, for the lightning&#8217;s speed! that I may not be late.<br />
The fields seem spinning round, the trees seem flying past,<br />
The engine thunders on, the station&#8217;s reached at last.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
And to my friend I haste, to greet him as of yore,<br />
Rejoicing in his thrift, I pause beside his door.<br />
A servant asks me in, and there upon his bed,<br />
Behold my dear old friend, who sent for me&#8212;just dead!
</p>

<p class="stanza">
I speak his name once more, and check the rising tears,<br />
And kiss his honest face, changed little through the years.<br />
&#8220;He asked for you,&#8221; they said, but could no longer wait;<br />
Alas! alas! to be but fifteen minutes late.

<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">James McCauley</span> was born August 23, 1809, near Mechanics Valley, in Cecil
county, and received his education in the log schoolhouse in that
neighborhood known as Maffit&#8217;s schoolhouse. He learned the trade of a
cooper with his father John McCauley. After coming of age he taught
school for a few years, and then commenced making threshing machines and
horse powers, doing the wood and iron work himself. In 1836 he removed
to New Leeds, where he has since resided.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1841, Mr. McCauley was appointed County Surveyor by Governor Pratt,
and served in that capacity for several years and has ever since
practiced land surveying with much success in all parts of Cecil county.
In 1857 he was elected Register of Wills and served until the Fall of
1863. In 1864 he was elected a delegate to the General Assembly of the
State, and served in the session of 1865, and the special session of
1866. Mr. McCauley has always been deeply interested in the cause of
education and was chairman of the committee on that subject in the House
of Delegates. While in the Legislature he was instrumental in securing
the passage of the law prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors in
Cecil county on election day.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In the early part of 1868 Mr. McCauley was appointed School
Commissioner, and soon afterwards Chief Judge of the Orphan&#8217;s Court, to
fill the vacancy caused by the death of the late Levi H. Evans, which he
did with so much acceptability that he has since been elected for four
terms of four years each.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1834, Mr. McCauley married Sarah, the youngest daughter of Hugh
Beard, a well-known surveyor of this county. His first wife died in
1846, leaving five children. In 1849 he married Millicent, daughter of
Jacob Price, of Sassafras Neck.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. McCauley commenced to write poetry when a young man and has
contributed poetry, but much more prose, to the newspapers of this
county during the last half century.

<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">Mrs. Ida McCormick</span> was born at Cameron Park, the family
homestead, one mile south of the pleasant little village of Zion,
Cecil county, Maryland, December 31, 1850. She is the daughter
of William Cameron (of Robert,) and a cousin of Annie M. Biles;
her mother Anna M. Oldham, being a sister of Catherine R. Oldham,
the mother of Annie M. Darlington, whose biography may
be found in this volume. She was educated at the Church-side
Seminary, at Zion, and at an early age engaged in teaching in the
public schools of her native county. She commenced to write
poetry when quite young, and for some years occasionally contributed
to the columns of the <i>Cecil Whig</i>.

<p class="prose">
On the 7th of August, 1873, she married James McCormick, of
Woodlawn, and for about a year after her marriage resided with
her husband near that place. In 1876 the family removed to

<h1><a id="s-a" name="s-a">Folger <span class="mc">Mc</span>Kinsey.</a></h1>


<p class="prose">
Folger McKinsey was born in Elkton, on the 29th of August, 1866, in the
cottage on Bow street now occupied by Thomas W. Green. His early life
was spent in Elkton, except a few years in childhood when his parents
resided in the West and South, until 1879, when they removed to
Philadelphia, taking their son with them. His paternal grandfather was a
Scotchman, and his grand parents on his mother&#8217;s side were Germans, from
the country bordering on the Rhine. Through the marriage of his maternal
great grandmother he is distantly related to Daniel Defoe, the author of
Robinson Crusoe. Both his parents are persons of intellectual ability,
and have written verse, his mother having been a contributor to the
local newspapers of this county, and to several western journals.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. McKinsey received his education at the primary school of Miss
Tabitha Jones, on Main street, in Elkton, where he was sent when seven
years of age. Except an attendance of eight months at the public school
of Elkton, he never attended any other schools. In early childhood he
showed a great desire to read, and is indebted to his relative, William
J. Jones, and to L. Marshall Haines and E.E. Ewing for the means of
gratifying his early thirst for information. Shortly after removing to
Philadelphia Mr. McKinsey entered a mercantile establishment as clerk,
but soon afterwards accepted a position in the office of a publishing
house, and subsequently entered the office of the Philadelphia and
Reading railroad company as clerk in the record department. While in the
office of the railroad company he wrote and published his first poem. It
is called &#8220;Satana Victo&#8221; and is written in blank verse. Since that time
he has been a prolific writer of both poetry and prose, much of which
has been published.

In October, 1884, Mr. McKinsey accepted the position of editor of the
<i>Shore Gazette</i>, a weekly journal published at Ocean Beach, N.J., which
he continued to fill for some months, when he returned to Philadelphia
and accepted a position as special writer on a prominent daily journal
of that city. In October, 1885, Mr. McKinsey accepted the position of
associate editor of the <i>Cecil Whig</i>, which he continued to fill until

Though young in years he writes with as much fluency and ease as if he
had been writing poetry for half an ordinary lifetime, and gives promise
of a brilliant career that will be creditable to his native town, and
beneficial to the human race.

<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">Rachel Elizabeth Patterson</span>, better known as Lizzie Patterson, is the
daughter of William Patterson and Sarah (Catts) Patterson, and was born
in Port Deposit, February 2, 1820. She is also the granddaughter of an
Englishman who settled on Taylor&#8217;s Island, in Chesapeake Bay, where he
owned considerable property, which by some means seems to have been lost
by his family.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Her father at one time kept a clothing store in Port Deposit, where he
died when the subject of this sketch was quite young, leaving a family
of helpless children, who were soon scattered among strangers. Elizabeth
was placed in a family residing a short distance south of the village of
Rising Sun. While in this family she was seized with a violent illness,
which confined her to bed for many months and from which she arose a
cripple and a sufferer for life.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Her poetic talent began to manifest itself in those early days of
suffering, and during subsequent years of confinement she found solace
and recreation by composing her &#8220;Songs in Affliction,&#8221; which about
thirty years ago, in accordance with the advice of her friends, she
published in a small volume bearing that name. The first edition
consisted of eight hundred, and was so well received as to warrant the
publication of another one of five hundred copies. In 1872 she published
another small volume, entitled &#8220;The Little Streamlet,&#8221; which contained
some poems written since the publication of the first volume. Miss
Patterson at present and for many years past has resided in Baltimore.

<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">Callander Patterson</span> was born near Perryville, Cecil county, May 6, 1820.
His education was obtained at the common schools of the neighborhood.
Many years ago he went to Philadelphia, where he studied dentistry,
which he has since practiced in that city. Mr. Patterson commenced
writing poetry when quite young, but published nothing until upwards of
forty years of age. His poetry&#8212;of which he has written much&#8212;seems to

<h1><a id="w-a" name="w-a">Tobias Rudulph.</a></h1>


<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">Tobias Rudulph</span>, the subject of this sketch, was the third person of that
name and was the grandson of the Tobias Rudulph, who was one of four
brothers who emigrated from Prussia and settled in Cecil county early in
the eighteenth century. For many years the family took a conspicuous
part in public affairs.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Tobias Rudulph&#8217;s uncle and his uncle&#8217;s cousin Michael, the son of Jacob,
and the uncle of Mrs. Lucretia Garfield, very early in the Revolutionary
war joined a company of Light Horsemen, which was recruited in this
county and served with great bravery and distinction in Light Horse
Harry Lee&#8217;s Legion in his Southern campaigns. They were called the Lions
of the Legion.
</p>

<p class="prose">
John Rudulph won the title of &#8220;Fighting Jack&#8221; by his courage and
audacity, both of which essential requisites of a good soldier he seems
to have possessed in a superabundant degree.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Tobias, the subject of this sketch, was born in Elkton, in the old brick
mansion two doors east of the court house, on December 8, 1787. He was
the oldest of four children, namely: Zebulon, a sketch of whose life
appears in this volume; Anna Maria, who married James Sewell; and
Martha, who married the Reverend William Torbert.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Anna Maria is said to have been a poetess of no mean ability, but owing
to the state of literature in this county at the time she wrote, none of
her poetry, so far as we have been able to learn was published, and
after diligent search we have been unable to find any of her manuscript.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Tobias studied law with his mother&#8217;s brother, James Milner, who resided
in Philadelphia, where he practiced law,&#8212;but who subsequently became a
distinguished Presbyterian minister and Doctor of Divinity&#8212;and was
admitted to the Elkton Bar and practiced his profession successfully
until the time of his death which occurred in the Fall of 1828. He was a
man of fine ability and amused himself when he had leisure in courting
the Muses, but owing to his excessive modesty published nothing now
extant except &#8220;Tancred, or The Siege of Antioch,&#8221; a drama in three acts,
which was printed in Philadelphia, in 1827. Owing to the fact that
simultaneously with its publication, a drama of the same name by another
author appeared as a candidate for literary favor, Mr. Rudulph&#8212;though
his work was highly commended by Joseph Jefferson the elder, then in
the height of his dramatic career, through the foolish fear that he
might he accused of plagiarism&#8212;suppressed his drama and never allowed
it to be introduced upon the stage.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Rudulph married Maria Hayes. They were the parents of four children,
Amelia, James, Anna Maria and Tobias. The two first mentioned are dead,
the others reside in Elkton. Until a very recent period the family
spelled the name Rudulph, which spelling has been followed in this work,
though the name is now generally spelled Rudolph.
</p>




<h3 class="title"><a id="w-b" name="w-b">Selection from Tancred.</a></h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="prose">
    Tancred was the son of the Marquis of Odo, surnamed the good, and
    Emma, the sister of Robert Guiscard who figured conspicuously in the
    wars which distracted Europe just previous to the first Crusade,
    which occurred under the leadership of Peter, the Hermit, and
    Walter, the Penniless, in A.D. 1096. The scene of the drama is laid
    at Antioch in 1097. A historian of the Crusades in speaking of the
    siege of Antioch, says that the wealth of the harvest and the
    vintage spread before them its irresistible temptations, and the
    herds feeding in the rich pastures seemed to promise an endless
    feast. The cattle, the corn and the wine were alike wasted with
    besotted folly, while the Turks within the walls received tidings of
    all that passed in the crusading camps from some Greek and Armenian
    christians to whom they allowed free egress and ingress. Of this
    knowledge they availed themselves in planing sallies by which they
    caused great distress to the Crusaders. The following extract
    comprises the third scene of the first act and is laid in the camp
    of the Crusaders&#8212;the chiefs being in council.

<h1><a id="x-a" name="x-a">Zebulon Rudulph.</a></h1>


<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">Zebulon Rudulph</span> was the second son of Tobias Rudulph, an account of
whose family is given elsewhere in this volume. He was born in Elkton,
June 28, 1794. Though well remembered by some of the older residents of
the place of his nativity who knew him when they were young, but little
is known of his early life except that he was possessed of a kind heart
and an affable disposition; and appears to have been more given to the
cultivation of his literary tastes, than to the practice of those
utilitarian traits which had they been more highly developed, would have
enabled him to have reaped a richer pecuniary harvest than fell to his
lot from the cultivation of the others.
</p>

<p class="prose">
For a time in early manhood Mr. Rudulph was engaged in merchandising in
Elkton, and subsequently became the first agent of the Philadelphia,
Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Company in that town, which office he
held from the time the company commenced business in 1837, until 1840 or
&#8217;41, when he removed to Memphis, Tennessee, where in 1847 he published a
small volume of 247 pages entitled &#8220;Every Man&#8217;s Book; or, the Road to
Heaven Staked Out; being a Collection of Holy Proofs Alphabetically
Arranged as a Text Book for Preachers and Laymen of all Denominations.&#8221;
Mr. Rudulph was a Universalist, and the object of the book was to
inculcate the tenets of that denomination.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Rudulph remained in Memphis for a few years and subsequently removed
to Izard county, Arkansas, where he died a short time before the
commencement of the war of the rebellion. He was a voluminous writer,
and the author of a large number of fugitive poems, many of which are
said to have been quite humorous and possessed of much literary merit.
Very few of his poems have been preserved, which is much regretted for
the reason that it is highly probable that those extant do not fully set
forth the poetical ability of their author. The following poems except
the one entitled &#8220;Thoughts on the Death of his grandchild Fanny,&#8221; were
published in <i>The Elkton Courier</i> nearly half a century ago.

<h1><a id="y-a" name="y-a">Mrs. Alice Coale Simpers.</a></h1>


<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">Mrs. Alice Coale Simpers</span> was born in the old brick mansion known as
&#8220;Traveler&#8217;s Repose,&#8221; a short distance south of Harrisville, in the Sixth
district of Cecil county, on the first day of December, 1843.
</p>

<p class="prose">
The Coale family of which Mrs. Simpers is a member, trace their descent
from Sir Philip Blodgett, a distinguished Englishman, who settled in
Baltimore shortly after its foundation, and are related to the Matthews,
Worthingtons, Jewetts, and other leading families of Harford county. On
her mother&#8217;s side she is related to the Jacksons, Puseys, and other
well-known Friends of Chester county, Pennsylvania, and Wilmington,
Delaware.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mrs. Simpers&#8217; early education was received at Waring&#8217;s Friends&#8217; School,
near the village of Colora, which was kept up by a few families of
Friends in the neighborhood. She also attended the State Normal School
in Baltimore, and qualified herself for teaching in the public schools
of the State, in which she taught for about ten years in Cecil county,
and also in Dorchester county. She also taught school in the State of
Illinois with great acceptability and success.
</p>

<p class="prose">
When Mrs. Simpers was quite young her father removed his family to the
banks of the romantic Octoraro, near Rowlandville, and within less than
two miles of the birth-place of the two poetic Ewings and the late John
Cooley, and the romantic spot where Mrs. Hall lived when she wrote the
poems which are published in this volume. The soul-inspiring beauty of
this romantic region seems to have had the same effect upon her mind as
it had upon the other persons composing the illustrious quintette, of
which she is a distinguished member, and when only seventeen years of
age she began to write poetry. At the solicitation of her friend, E.E.
Ewing, she sent the first poem she published to him, who gave it a place
in <i>The Cecil Whig</i>, of which he was the editor and proprietor.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1875 Mrs. Simpers began to write for the New York <i>Mercury</i>, which
then numbered among its contributors Ned Buntline, Harriet Prescott,
George Marshall, George Arnold, Bayard Taylor, W. Scott Way, and many
other distinguished writers with whom she ranked as an equal in many
respects, and many of whom she excelled as a brilliant satirist and
pathetic painter of the quaint and the beautiful.
</p>

<p class="prose">
For ten years she continued to contribute letters, essays, stories and
poems to the <i>Mercury</i>, and to advocate the claims of her sex to the
right of suffrage, in which she still continues to be a firm believer.
Mrs. Simpers has also contributed largely to the <i>Woman&#8217;s Journal</i> and
other periodicals.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Though possessed of a brilliant poetic genius, Mrs. Simpers is best
known as a writer of prose; and, in addition to the large quantity of
matter she has contributed to the newspaper press, is the author of a
story of about two hundred pages illustrative of the principles and
practices and exemplifying the social life of the Friends, for which she
received a prize of two hundred dollars. This story was highly spoken of
by Dr. Shelton McKenzie, with whom she was on terms of intimacy for some
years immediately before his death, and also by many other distinguished
writers.
</p>

<p class="prose">
On the 22d of February, 1879, the subject of this sketch married Captain
John G. Simpers, who served with distinction in the Second Regiment
Delaware Volunteers in the war of the rebellion. They, at the time of
writing this sketch, reside near the summit of Mount Pleasant, and
within a short distance of the birth-place of Emma Alice Browne.

<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">David Scott</span> (of James,) so called to distinguish him from his first
cousin, David Scott (of John)&#8212;to a sketch of whose life the reader is
referred for other information respecting the family&#8212;was born on his
father&#8217;s farm, called &#8220;Scott&#8217;s Adventure,&#8221; on the road leading from
Cowantown to Newark and about two miles from the former place, on
January 7, 1824 and died at Elkton, May 13, 1879.
</p>

<p class="prose">
His early life was spent on the farm, and in learning the trade of auger
making, at which his father was an expert workman. His education was
obtained at the common schools of the neighborhood, except that which he
obtained by attending Newark Academy for a few months in early manhood.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In early life he became enamoured of learning, and commenced teaching a
private school in the family mansion in the winter of 1840, when only
seventeen years old, and continued to teach in the neighborhood until
1851, when he was appointed Clerk to the County Commissioners and
removed to Elkton. Mr. Scott was a Democrat, and from early life took an
active part in the politics of his native country. After serving as
Clerk to the Commissioners for one term of two years, Mr. Scott started
a general warehouse business at the Elkton depot, in which he continued
as head of the firm of D. Scott &#38; Bro. until the time of his death.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1867 he was elected Clerk of the Circuit Court for Cecil county, and
served six years with great acceptability.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1876 Mr. Scott was appointed Chief Weigher, and continued to have
charge of the State Cattle Scales in the city of Baltimore, until the
time of his death.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In 1852 Mr. Scott was married to Miss Mary Jane Wilson, of Newark. They
were the parents of three children, two of whom are now living. His
first wife died in 1858, and he subsequently married Miss Annie
Elizabeth Craig, who, with their four children, still survives him.
</p>

<p class="prose">
In early life Mr. Scott began to write poetry, and continued to write
for the local newspapers under the nom de plume of &#8220;Anselmo,&#8221; and the
Philadelphia <i>Dollar Newspaper</i> during the time he was engaged in
teaching school, and occasionally for the county papers until the close
of his life.
</p>

<p class="prose">
For many years Mr. Scott enjoyed the friendship of the literati of
Newark, Delaware, and was one of a large number of poetical writers who
contributed to the columns of the Philadelphia <i>Dollar Newspaper</i>, with
several of whom he enjoyed a personal acquaintance, and with several
others of whom he carried on a literary correspondence for several
years.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Scott, though not a voluminous writer, was the author of a
considerable number of poems, all of which were of a highly intellectual
character.

<h1><a id="aa-a" name="aa-a">Henry Vanderford.</a></h1>


<p class="prose">
<span class="bio-subject">Henry Vanderford</span>, editor and journalist, was born at Hillsborough,
Caroline county, Md., December 23, 1811. His maternal ancestors were
from Wales, his paternal from Holland. He was educated at Hillsborough
Academy, a celebrated institution at that time, having pupils from the
adjoining counties of Queen Anne&#8217;s and Talbot. He acquired a knowledge
of the art of printing in the office of the <i>Easton Star</i>, Thomas Perrin
Smith, proprietor. From 1835 to 1837 he published the <i>Caroline
Advocate</i>, Denton, Md., the only paper in the county, and neutral in
politics, though the editor was always a decided Democrat, and took an
active part in the reform movement of 1836, which resulted in the
election of the &#8220;Glorious Nineteen&#8221; and the Twenty-one Electors. The
press and type of the <i>Advocate</i> were transferred in 1837 to
Centreville, Queen Anne&#8217;s county, where he founded the <i>Sentinel</i>, the
first Democratic paper published in that county, in January, 1838. He
was appointed for three successive years by Governor Grason chief judge
of the Magistrate&#8217;s Court, but declined the office. In 1840 he was
appointed Deputy Marshal for Queen Anne&#8217;s, and took the census of that
county in that year. In 1842 he sold the <i>Sentinel</i> and removed to
Baltimore, where, three years later, he resumed his profession and
founded <i>The Ray</i>, a weekly literary and educational journal, and the
subsequent year published the <i>Baltimore Daily News</i>, and the <i>Weekly
Statesman</i>, in company with Messrs. Adams and Brown, under the firm of
Adams, Vanderford &#38; Brown. The <i>News</i> and <i>Statesman</i> were Democratic
papers. In February, 1848, he bought <i>The Cecil Democrat</i> of Thomas M.
Coleman, enlarged the paper, quadrupled its circulation, and refitted it
with new material. In 1865 he sold out the <i>Democrat</i> to Albert
Constable and Judge Frederick Stump, and bought a farm in St. Mary&#8217;s
county, Md., and engaged in agriculture. Three years later, failing
health of himself and family, induced him to sell his farm and remove to
Middletown, Del., where he founded the <i>Transcript</i>, and resumed the
business of a printer and publisher. The <i>Transcript</i> was the first
paper published in that town, and was a success from the start. It was
transferred in 1870 to his youngest son, Charles H. Vanderford. From
1870 to 1878 he was associated with his eldest son, William H.
Vanderford, in the publication of <i>The Democratic Advocate</i>,
Westminster, Md. In 1873 he was elected to the House of Delegates from
Carroll county, and in 1879 to the Senate, in which body he held the
important position of Chairman of the Committee on Finance, and was a
member of the Committee on Engrossed Bills and the Committee on
Printing.
</p>

<p class="prose">
On the 6th of June, 1839, he married Angelina, the daughter of Henry
Vanderford, of Queen Anne&#8217;s county, a distant relative of his father.
Mr. Vanderford is a member of the Masonic Order, and he and his wife are
both communicants of the Protestant Episcopal Church, the Church of
their ancestors, as far back as the history of the Church can be traced
in the Eastern part of Maryland. Charles Vanderford, great grandfather
of the subject of this sketch, was a vestryman of St. Paul&#8217;s Parish,
Centreville, Md., in 1719. Charles Wrench Vanderford was his
grandfather, and a member of the Old Maryland Line, in the Revolutionary
war. William Vanderford, his father, was a native of Queen Anne&#8217;s
county, where the family held a grant of land of one thousand acres from
the crown, located between Wye Mills and Hall&#8217;s Cross Roads, on which
the old mansion was built of brick imported from England.
</p>

<p class="prose">
Mr. Vanderford is now in retiracy, in the 76th year of his age, but
still active, and in the possession of good health and as genial and
cheerful as in the days of his prime.

    Written after a visit to Rawley Springs, in the mountains of
    Virginia.

<p class="stanza">
On the mountains! Oh, how sweet!<br />
The busy world beneath my feet!<br />
Outspread before my raptur&#8217;d eyes<br />
The wide unbounded prospect lies;<br />
The panoramic vision glows<br />
In beauty, grandeur and repose.<br />
I gaze into the vaulted blue<br />
And on the em&#8217;rald fields below;<br />
The genial sunlight shimmers down<br />
Upon the mountain&#8217;s rugged crown,<br />
The eye sweeps round the horizon<br />
Until its utmost verge is won.<br />
The hoary peaks, with forests crown&#8217;d,<br />
Spread their vast solitudes around,<br />
And intervening rocks and rills<br />
The eye with very transport fills.<br />
The bosom wells with joy serene<br />
While viewing all the lovely scene,<br />
The spirit soars on airy wings<br />
Above all sublunary things.<br />
I peer into the depths profound<br />
Of the cerulean around,<br />
And ether&#8217;s far-off heights I scan,<br />
As if, to feeble finite man,<br />
The power of vision here were given<br />
To view the battlements of heaven.<br />
But, though I gaze and gaze intent,<br />
Close scanning all the firmament,<br />
No Mount of Vision unto me<br />
Does this bold summit prove to be.<br />
Though in elysian wrapt the while,<br />
Where sublimated thoughts beguile,<br />
Icarian pinions, all too frail,<br />
Were sure my fancy&#8217;s flight to fail.<br />
Confined within this mortal clod,<br />
Vain man would yet ascend to God,<br />
Presumptuous, as of yore, to be<br />
The heir of immortality.<br />
But, from those fair, celestial heights<br />
Of fervid fancy&#8217;s loftiest flights,<br />
My airy visions topple down<br />
To where cool reason&#8217;s realm is found,<br />
And fancy folds her weary wings,<br />
Content, the while, with earthly things.

<h3 class="subtitle">On Witnessing Three Sisters Depositing Flowers on the Grave of a Friend,
in St. Ann&#8217;s Cemetery, Middletown, Delaware.</h3>

<p class="stanza">
At an early hour of the Sabbath morn,<br />
Beside the ancient, sacred pile, I stood<br />
Of old St. Ann&#8217;s. The ivy careless clamber&#8217;d<br />
Along its moss-grown, antique walls;<br />
The sun-light bathed in golden glory<br />
The calm, sequester&#8217;d scene, and silence<br />
Reigned through all the leafy grove,<br />
Save where the warbling songster pour&#8217;d<br />
His wood-notes wild, or where &#8220;the gray old trunks<br />
That high in heaven mingled their mossy boughs,&#8221;<br />
Murmur&#8217;d with sound of &#8220;the invisible breath<br />
That played among their giant branches,&#8221;<br />
And &#8220;bowed the wrapt spirit with the thought<br />
Of boundless power and inaccessible majesty.&#8221;<br />
Within the lone church no loitering footfall<br />
O&#8217;er threshold, aisle, or chancel echoed,<br />
No sound intruded on the hush profound<br />
Of that ancient temple. The pale sleepers<br />
In the weird city of the dead lay mute,<br />
Their mouldering ashes mingling with the dust,<br />
While sculptured tablets with memorial brief,<br />
Their memories from oblivion rescued.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
As thus upon the scene around I gazed,<br />
The fresh-turned earth upon a new-made grave,<br />
Within its marble confines neat enclosed,<br />
My vision steadfast fixed, and I beheld<br />
Three maidens, bearing each a rich bouquet,<br />
Approach the tomb, and softly by its side<br />
Stoop down and place thereon their floral gems<br />
In token of the love they bore the friend<br />
So late inurned, whom yet they fondly cherish&#8217;d.<br />
Full preparation one had duly made<br />
To stand beside her at the bridal altar;<br />
But now, beside her early grave she stood,<br />
With floral tokens of unfailing love<br />
For the fair young wither&#8217;d flower beneath.<br />
Touching and beautiful the lovely sight<br />
Of such devotion deep at friendship&#8217;s shrine.<br />
My sterner heart, in welling sympathy,<br />
Throbb&#8217;d its response to this ennobling act<br />
Of these fair sisters, and did them homage<br />
Deep down within its silent recesses.<br />
Oh, when with them life&#8217;s fitful fever ends<br />
May ne&#8217;er be wanted hand of sympathy<br />
To strew affection&#8217;s token o&#8217;er their graves.
</p>



<h3 class="title"><a id="aa-f" name="aa-f">Merry May.</a></h3>

Ethereal mildness, gentle showers.<br />
Springing verdure, opening flowers,<br />
Apple blossoms, bobolinks,<br />
Budding roses, blushing pinks,<br />
Cherries snowy, peach buds sleek,<br />
Rivaling a maiden&#8217;s cheek,<br />
Balmy zephyrs, halcyon hours,<br />
Song of birds and scent of flowers,<br />
Vernal season, swelling spray,<br />
All belong to Merry May.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
